       " <comment rating=\"7\" username=\"agentpatman\" value=\"I love engine building and I love building combos but there is something that didn't quite work for me on this one. I will preface this with my opinion that probably looking for something this game is not and I might not be the right audience. After some reflection, I think what I dislike is that you have to challenge yourself and add your own complexity to make this game have interesting decisions. There is a turning point about half way through where your engine is so strong you can do whatever you want and get whatever you need and just start cashing in for the next 20 minutes. It becomes less interesting when the strategy is done and you are essentially racing to the finish. I wish personally the engine was more difficult to build or the cards were more difficult to pull off. The most expensive card in the game you could technically get it in 5 turns or less without implementing any strategy. Compare that to century spice or other games and you have to make quite a few clever moves to pull off your first card. You have to add your own cleverness or complexity by trying to build your engine a certain way rather than just grab what you need. I certainly enjoyed the first half of the way of building the initial engine and figuring out what combos well with what. I also wonder if the game wouldn't be better without the filing aspect and have that be another challenge of trying to be the first to obtain those cards rather than reserving them. I also think researching adds the ability to also just grab what you need without much work as well. I'd also prefer if the cards were more expensive or varied so you were incentivized to build a multi-layered engine rather than an engine that gives you blues and researching and building all blue cards.   The overall experience was enjoyable and entertaining, I just don't think there is enough meat or complexity or something here for me to be rewarded or clever with the strategy. Pulling off big combos is certainly very fun, but I wish it was harder to obtain and less frequently used rather than every turn just piling on more and more as you race to the end. The end game trigger of reaching a certain size is also pretty strange as there was never a natural ending so someone said, that's too powerful, lets stop here. I would have rather seen it done in a certain number of rounds, or maybe don't refill the tower and that triggers the game so investing in certain strategies makes sense based on what was used and what is left. I think any of those combinations would make this more strategic and something I would enjoy more. However as a lighter entertaining time, I think this is certainly unique because of the marbles and 3D tower but it could have been anything.\"/>,\n",

       " <comment rating=\"6\" username=\"Amicable_Ignoramus\" value=\"Solid game, just not my favorite from Walker-Harding. The marble dispenser is a gimmick that works &quot;ok&quot; which is almost always my feeling when it comes marble dispensers in boardgames and their integration with the game itself. Structurally, it gets the job done but at least once a game someone would accidentally bump a marble back which pushes it off the track and falls underneath the dispenser. It also feels a bit empty all the time, though we never actually ran out. It just takes a bit away from the experience when you get told to &quot;reach in and grab a marble&quot;, only to always be scraping around the bottom.  The game itself is about setting up your own engine that will string combo after combo together to gather or convert your marbles, build your &quot;gizmo&quot; cards that will give you more potential combo points, and turn all of these into victory points.  The biggest problem I have with the game is it feels a bit too &quot;one note&quot;. Those combos aren't dynamic enough so after game 2 or 3, you know what you should be looking to build and then it's just a matter of who the cards come out for. Maybe this was just a &quot;meta&quot; issue with our family, but I went out of my way to try to find other paths to victory and they never worked out.  Runaway leader is a pretty real thing here since the game ends up feeling like a tableau driven race, but with no real catch up mechanisms, which is exacerbated by the &quot;one note&quot; combo path. This feeds into the other issue where at the end of the game, turns bog down while people resolve their 5+ step combos.  All that being said, the game is cute and the combos are fun to figure out in the beginning. It's good for children and fine for adults who just want something light, though a bit long for what it is.\"/>,\n",
