# BGGAnalysis
Analysis of Board Game Geek (BGG) Information, using the XML API

Current steps taken in project:

* Scraped top 1000 games as of August 2021. For each game, obtained the player counts, play time, year of release, mechanics, categories, and rating stats
* Analyzed which mechanics and categories are the most popular, highly rated, and divisive
* Analyzed the relationship between play time, player count, and rating
* Analyzed game comment for Gizmos

I have currently scraped player ratings for ~400 of the 1000 pages. I plan to create a recommendation system with this data.
