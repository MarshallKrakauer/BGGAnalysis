# BGGAnalysis
Analysis of Board Game Geek (BGG) Information, using the XML API

Current steps taken in project:

* Scraped top 1000 games as of August 2021. For each game, obtained the player counts, play time, year of release, mechanics, categories, and rating stats
* Analyzed which mechanics and categories are the most popular, highly rated, and divisive
* Analyzed the relationship between play time and rating

Future plans:
* Analyze relationship between year of relase and rating
* * Hypothesis: more recent games are more highly rated
* Analysis of player counts
* * Hypothesis: Games with viable solo modes are more highly rated
* Market basket analysis based on player ratings
* NLP Analysis of player ratings or game descriptions
