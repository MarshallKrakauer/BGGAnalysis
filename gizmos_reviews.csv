246192,8.0,4ndrewcol3,My favorite shorter game
246192,6.0,Abdul,"Decent but forgettable. I would have expected at least some names for the various cards to inject a little theme into the gameplay. Just too dry and simple for me. The marble dispenser is cute, but kept breaking and dropping marbles onto the table."
246192,10.0,AbleCompany,My pick for an engine building game with just the right kind of theming and accessible play.

246192,7.0,Achire,"Light game. Pretty fun with all the card combos and I like the mechanics a lot. The marble randomization is pretty cool. The only thing I don't like is the game length - it feels a little too short, so it doesn't really feel like your engine actually comes together before the game ends. The super-short length also makes it really hard to come back from bad luck. So good game that I'd be happy to play, but don't feel the need to own it."

246192,6.0,adamredwoods,"1 play / 3 players (1 child)  LIKE: Engine building is fun, as well as creating some nice big combos. Pulling marbles out randomly has a nice tactile feel.  DISLIKE: The different marble colors can come out randomly as six of the same colors and if there is nothing to do with the single color, it can clog the game flow. The cards can come out random, and again if a particular color seems to be rarer than others, it can swing the game a little. The extra-point-per-3-points card seemed under-valued. Minimal player interaction.  OVERALL: Very light game, good for families because the marbles are nice. Some novice players found it difficult to know the order of what triggers, but after a few turns it starts to work for them. Similar to, but I prefer Splendor.   Similar games: Splendor, Century Spice Road."
246192,9.0,adamscott,"Another solid Phil Walker-Harding game.  Easy to learn, but enough strategic depth to satisfy.  After two plays, I really enjoy it and have put it on my wish list.  Not sure how long it'll hold my attention since it's so light, but great game for now!"
246192,8.0,adamw,It is very fun - like a small step up from Splendor or Century Spice Road because it has combos that are quite satisfying. The end game scoring could be close - or could be a blow out depending on a few of those Level 3 cards that can really score big if combined well. Very fun and delightful in production!
246192,8.0,Addiction2k,"Its got some broken level 3 cards, However if you remove those cards it gets more even and replayable. It’s actually a little better an I oiriginally thought. And new gamers love this once the light bulb goes on for them."
246192,8.0,aeaswen,This is a great game for what it is. A light game that is quick that will introduce players to engine building and combo type games. I have enjoyed every play of it.
246192,7.0,agentpatman,"I love engine building and I love building combos but there is something that didn't quite work for me on this one. I will preface this with my opinion that probably looking for something this game is not and I might not be the right audience. After some reflection, I think what I dislike is that you have to challenge yourself and add your own complexity to make this game have interesting decisions. There is a turning point about half way through where your engine is so strong you can do whatever you want and get whatever you need and just start cashing in for the next 20 minutes. It becomes less interesting when the strategy is done and you are essentially racing to the finish. I wish personally the engine was more difficult to build or the cards were more difficult to pull off. The most expensive card in the game you could technically get it in 5 turns or less without implementing any strategy. Compare that to century spice or other games and you have to make quite a few clever moves to pull off your first card. You have to add your own cleverness or complexity by trying to build your engine a certain way rather than just grab what you need. I certainly enjoyed the first half of the way of building the initial engine and figuring out what combos well with what. I also wonder if the game wouldn't be better without the filing aspect and have that be another challenge of trying to be the first to obtain those cards rather than reserving them. I also think researching adds the ability to also just grab what you need without much work as well. I'd also prefer if the cards were more expensive or varied so you were incentivized to build a multi-layered engine rather than an engine that gives you blues and researching and building all blue cards.   The overall experience was enjoyable and entertaining, I just don't think there is enough meat or complexity or something here for me to be rewarded or clever with the strategy. Pulling off big combos is certainly very fun, but I wish it was harder to obtain and less frequently used rather than every turn just piling on more and more as you race to the end. The end game trigger of reaching a certain size is also pretty strange as there was never a natural ending so someone said, that's too powerful, lets stop here. I would have rather seen it done in a certain number of rounds, or maybe don't refill the tower and that triggers the game so investing in certain strategies makes sense based on what was used and what is left. I think any of those combinations would make this more strategic and something I would enjoy more. However as a lighter entertaining time, I think this is certainly unique because of the marbles and 3D tower but it could have been anything."
246192,7.0,AidanValkyrie,"VIE/OFF  Despite Gizmo being distributed in Vietnam, the price is extremely ridiculous, components quality is a joke, wouldn’t be buying if this is not discounted. Gameplay is decent, willing to play again sometimes."
246192,7.0,Ajax,Really nice engine-building game.  It ramps up well from truly simple to slightly mind-melting.  Almost goes on a little long.  Good use of iconography and insert.
246192,7.0,ajax013,"+ Great match of simple rules with escalating gameplay; as silly as it is, the energy dispenser adds a lot to the appeal of this game. - I actually wish that the four energy types weren't symmetric in what they offer... it would have been cool is heat energy was somehow inherently different than atomic energy, etc.   Why it's previously-owned: The thematic detachment... why couldn't they take time to make gizmos for each energy type feel different and unique and interesting.  Just felt close to something amazing that it bothered me each time I played."
246192,7.0,ajewo,"Action selection game with card drafting. Players are tinkers who build gizmos. Colored marbles represent power required for the colored cards (gizmos). A three dimensional cardboard cue shows which marbles come next.   Pros: + Components (tactile, big marbles, marble tower) + Built gizmos grant special powers, e.g., converters, additional marbles (engine building) + Upgrade your stats + Convert marbles give flexibility + Satisfying combo building that mixes short-term and mid-term planing + Quick playing time  Neutrals: # Rather abstract game # Random draw of marbles # Family game # Higher player counts create more unpredictability for the available marbles.  Cons: - Starts a bit slow - Over the course of the game, there are a lot of triggered effects to keep track of (potential analysis paralysis may slow down the game)  Similar games: * Mechanica (factory, spatial puzzle, swingy market, cool theme integration) * Potion Explosion (very luck-based)"

246192,9.0,akmalfikri,"My go to engine building game. Easy to set up, easy to play. I can play with nieces and nephews."
246192,9.0,Al Capwnd You,"Gismos feels like a lighter version of Terraforming Mars in terms of an engine builder. A card-and-marble engine building game where you can chain/domino abilities. The marbles might initially think of a kid's game, but there is a good bit of strategy to make an efficient engine work towards earning you points and not just spinning its wheels.  Terraforming Mars feels like it is a more mature game with more depth, but Gizmos is easier to get to the table for a family. If you enjoy engine builders, Gizmos is a great addition as a lightweight introductory game that will still be fun after the initial play."
246192,6.0,Alannamairead,"engine builder, neat design but can be a bit slow if you don't get your engine up and running pretty quickly"
246192,7.0,alrusdi,"Great mix of Potion Explosion, Splendor and Space Explorers with super dynamic gameplay  "
246192,6.0,AmandaDesignsGames,"A cool concept, great table present, but the game felt very flat to me. No build up, no tension, just going through the motion more and more."

246192,7.5,AmethystJewel,2/20 E23 Nice medium weight game where you try to get an engine going. Gotta pay attention to all of the tiles you have laid down as chaining is a big part of this game.

246192,6.0,Amicable_Ignoramus,"Solid game, just not my favorite from Walker-Harding. The marble dispenser is a gimmick that works ""ok"" which is almost always my feeling when it comes marble dispensers in boardgames and their integration with the game itself. Structurally, it gets the job done but at least once a game someone would accidentally bump a marble back which pushes it off the track and falls underneath the dispenser. It also feels a bit empty all the time, though we never actually ran out. It just takes a bit away from the experience when you get told to ""reach in and grab a marble"", only to always be scraping around the bottom.  The game itself is about setting up your own engine that will string combo after combo together to gather or convert your marbles, build your ""gizmo"" cards that will give you more potential combo points, and turn all of these into victory points.  The biggest problem I have with the game is it feels a bit too ""one note"". Those combos aren't dynamic enough so after game 2 or 3, you know what you should be looking to build and then it's just a matter of who the cards come out for. Maybe this was just a ""meta"" issue with our family, but I went out of my way to try to find other paths to victory and they never worked out.  Runaway leader is a pretty real thing here since the game ends up feeling like a tableau driven race, but with no real catch up mechanisms, which is exacerbated by the ""one note"" combo path. This feeds into the other issue where at the end of the game, turns bog down while people resolve their 5+ step combos.  All that being said, the game is cute and the combos are fun to figure out in the beginning. It's good for children and fine for adults who just want something light, though a bit long for what it is."

246192,9.0,AnalagousParabolas,"Great engine building game that rewards good strategy but remains forgiving if (when) you need to change tracks.  Most importantly, the theme and components mean your turns are fun to map out and just as fun to watch the other player's gizmos chain together."

246192,8.0,andriytom,It's like Splendor but better
246192,7.0,andshar,"Fun, fast light/filler game. It is possible for someone to get a great combo working and run away with the game."
246192,6.0,Andy Parsons,"A simple engine builder with the gimmick of a cardboard marble dispenser. The marbles are resources used to purchase new engine parts.  A limited set of dispensed marbles and players' limited capacity to store them place constraints on the engine parts you can buy.  I found Gizmos quick and inoffensive and forgettable.  Production quality is mostly good, though the engine part cards are a little thin.  The artwork is functional."
246192,7.75,andy61,"Simple and fun engine-builder.  Little bit of a runaway leader problem, but it isn't that long."

246192,10.0,archrobin,"Love it. Engine builder, card game with excellent mechanics :)"
246192,6.0,Arcturian,"A quick and pretty decent engine builder, though it has neither the sophistication of the heavier games in that genre nor the charming simplicity of Splendor, and I'm not sure I need anything in between."
246192,9.0,arglik,Cool and fun game where you want to experiment more with chaining your machine's action more than winning. And usually I don't win anyway.
246192,7.6,arildoaim,"Good engine builder that replaces Azul for me in the ""superfiller""-niche. Fast game, but packing. Elegant design. Family friendly. Effortless to bring to the table.  Playing this after Tapestry was a great relievement.  Concerns: - Needs some plays to see if still holds up, or gets samey. - Some strategies are clearly superior? Can be migiated by houserouling. - Turns can be very fast, so if one particular player got AP it will be noticable."
246192,5.0,Arkeas,Light little engine building game. Simple to teach and play but the game becomes quite dull and repetitive after just a few plays and the choices are never particularly interesting. Ended up trading this one.

246192,8.0,Arydis4,"Very good engine builder.  It is easy to teach and plays in 45 minutes.  Won my copy at the CMON Expo in 2019.  The marbles give a nice gimmick to the resources for table presence, but the meat of the game is the cards.    After 10+ plays the gameplay does become repetitive. (9-30-19)  "

246192,8.0,astroglide,"Probably overrating this to start. I can enjoy a nice, quick snowball. This does the trick, and also presses some MTG-like buttons with how many triggered responses there are to manage on a given turn. Similar to Splendor, but just enough oomph to make it more interesting in both gameplay and physical appeal for me."
246192,10.0,awarb,One of our favorites.  Great engine-building mechanics.  Its really fun to build up a set of actions and then take epic turns.

246192,3.0,BallenFam,the randomized marbles are neat but the convoluted way the gizmos are acquired and used is boring.
246192,8.2,baltruce,"Really liked my first game of this, kept thinking about the nice flavor it left in my mouth even after 4 days (all that through the Essen Spiel fair) and that says it all. UPDATE: A truly elegant design, simple but not simplistic. It looks nice on the table (although I do join others saying that the ball dispenser has its issues). It's a cery interesting engine-building game that my girlfriend liked (and that could be enough for me already). Component quality is great for the price-point of this game. I can only hope for future expansions that could eleviate my sole minor problem with the game with 2p, which is that is can bog down when the balls available do not match the available cards, something that prolongs the game, making both players huffing and puffing for a break. Come on CMON..   "

246192,6.5,Bayushi Sezaru,"If Splendor and Potion Explosion had a baby, it would be called Gizmos... This game is essentially a big box filler: players build “gizmos” using colored, coming out from a dispenser. Gizmos are cards with various power, generating a variety of combos. Fun game, while not groundbreaking as a design."

246192,10.0,bgrubaugh,"Fantastic light engine builder. The marble holder is not as gimmicky as it might appear and the way it uses the ""preview"" line with a ""blind pick"" is nice.  Overall this game offers a ton of replay value in a very short game, which is rare."
246192,6.0,bhudson1972,"Very clever game. It is more strategic than it looks. Can actually become quite heated as players select cards that others are waiting to build. Often, a card will come out that you want, but it will get selected prior to your turn coming back around. The contraption that holds the marbles works well enough. I could see it getting worn down and tearing up at some point. I think this game has a good look that will get people to ask about it. Very fun."
246192,8.0,biasedisland,What a great little engine builder! Think Splendor with marbles but better. One of our favorites behind Wingspan. We love the light theme. It's strategic and plays very fast. Seems to scale very well IMO. Would highly recommend.
246192,7.0,BigD527,"I like the engine-building twist of this one, and the fact that it has a significant tactile component gives it nice table appeal. A solid gateway."
246192,7.0,Billnyhilist,"Really nice little engine builder, feels a bit barebones for some reason even though you have a handful of strategies and actions to build upon; perhaps because the gizmos all feel so abstract and unthematic? (get the tile that gets more blue, draw more cards, etc.) I do like the marble system for available energy you can pick and compete for."
246192,5.0,birdsong703,Doesn’t live up to the hype - feels derivative.
246192,7.0,bivaterl,"Very light, but has some neat engine-building. I think I still like the purity of Splendor as an engine builder, but this is fun to kick-off a big set of events. This is a good, light game that actually comes in under an hour. If it had been before Potion Explosion and Splendor, it would have felt more groundbreaking. As it is, this feels like the child of those games. That doesn't make it bad, just less unique feeling because of it."
246192,9.0,blondeslovetoshop,"Edgar owns, very fun game"
246192,7.4,bm6262,What Splendor should be.  For a comboey game I choose Council of 4 over this.
246192,5.0,bneffer,I love physical components - so drawing marbles of energy was fun. Building an engine is fun as well. But the whole point is VP gathering and the theme is thin.
246192,5.0,bnordeng,"Gizmos reminded me a bit of Splendor. It's a very basic system of engine-building. But, Gizmos is a bit more interesting with a few more interactive parts. And, the engine-building part of Gizmos is way more interesting than what I remember from Splendor (if you call that engine-building or stacking or whatever). If I were just getting into board games, I could see playing this again. As it is, I don't see myself ever playing this title again. I didn't dislike the game, I just didn't like it all that much either. "
246192,6.5,bnvt,"A pure engine builder; the marbles and dispenser look really nice, but the graphic design on the cards somehow made the whole thing a bit confusing to me."
246192,7.0,boardgamearchive,2020 I don't like it at 2 player count and that's the reason it left my collection and the reason I give this rating.  
246192,7.8,BoltKey,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS I heard that it is Splendor with some Potion Explosion mixed in. It definitely felt like it has the good parts of both of the two. The individual turns, although you combo up many things, don't take so long (unlike Potion Explosion, which had issue with too long individual turns and big downtime).  The combos towards the end get huge, maybe a bit too much even. Liked it.  2019-02-19 rating changed 7.5 -> 6.5. Low replay value, there is a single dominant strategy."
246192,6.0,bombstone9,just okay
246192,7.0,Bond8089,"Solid engine building game that is a step up from Splendor.  Cool table presence, and enough depth to offer repeated plays even to gamers."
246192,6.0,booned,"It's tough to rate this a 6. The game is not bad, and the components of the second edition are lovely. I'm not that surprised by its high ratings. Really, it's not a [i]bad[/i] game at all. I'd be hard-pressed to find something singularly [i]wrong[/i] with the game. I just don't much care for games about building combos. It's fun for some people, but not me."
246192,5.0,boredbeyondbelief,I like tableau builders and this engine builder had a little feel like that. But it got confusing as you had to be jumping around your board to see what activated. Pass.
246192,6.0,Born-of-Ashes,Nice intro engine builder with superb toy factor. Linking ball color to effect category is always tricky and doesn't feel entirely balanced here. This leads to dominant strategies and repetitive play.
246192,3.0,Boshia,"Sold. I felt like the game just started when we finised the game so it felt so unnecessary to ""build"" the engine.  The game felt similar and meh. I will play splendor instead."
246192,6.0,Boxatoys,I think this one doesn't get much table time because I got it the same time as some other similar games and we've enjoyed the others more.  I don't know when/if this will ever get back to the table.
246192,6.0,bponnaluri,"I enjoy Gizmos as a quick strategy game that has a lot of interesting decisions. However, the game feels a bit too tactical for my tastes, and it sometimes feels like multiplayer solitaire."

246192,7.0,Brekhof,This one is a solid little engine builder from one of my favorite designers. I let it go because there are more interesting engine builders and also with better replay value.
246192,7.0,brentont,good engine builder. the dispenser is a little fiddly. i think i might get a bag to draw the marbles out of.  tried with drawing out of the bag. dont do it. stick to the dispenser.

246192,7.0,brewsaki,"Very tactile. Love the colorful energy balls. Quick game. It's kind of hard to keep track of all the combos near the end of the game. This gave me a similar feeling to Splendor, but a bit more complex."
246192,6.0,brw12,"1 play:  Really enjoyed my first play. Like a combination between Splendor and 7 Wonders. Building the engine is satisfying, and there are always several good choices.  Several of the mechanics are really satisfying, and the components are well done and make collecting the energy marbles fun. I loved doing ""research"", building capacity, and hitting a chain I've set up.  The theme felt flat to me, though. There is no connection between the colors/types of energy and any particular functions; for a game with a seemingly strong theme, the cards are completely divorced from it and feel interchangeable. (That aspect is similar to Forbidden Island.)  The game also felt a bit long and anticlimactic, finishing with an ""okay, everyone count their points"" shrug. The rules didn't help, because they buried several key rules and left them in the middle of paragraphs of text.  Last, there's no clear way to keep track of which cards have been used during a chain reaction and which haven't.  All that said, it has a very fun core mechanic, even if it's not the finely tuned machine that 7 Wonders or Dominion are.   Lightness (1)-Heaviness (5) rating: 3"
246192,7.0,bryanruhe,"Fun, if a little basic. The aesthetics and the sphere dispenser are super lovely. Like Splendor, but actually interesting to me, and with some chance that keeps it from being a think-really-hard-to-win fest."

246192,5.0,btasam,"Accessible and satirical, Gizmos is a card-tableau building game that allows players an upgradable action board, but like its predecessors, fails to leave a lastly impression.  Unsurprisingly, gameplay leans a bit arbitrary and reactive, but I really enjoy how this situational play diminishes as the game goes on. Many of the benefits felt immediate; usually a built card could be used the following turn which allowed for some planning. The impact of the variable setup is low and thus the actual game to game experience felt predictable. It's fine, it's light, but there's other things I'd rather play."
246192,6.0,bubblepipemedia,"Fantastic simple game. It reminds me of Spendor, but that game got less fun every time I played it. This one I've only played once (currently). I wouldn't buy this game, but I would probably trade for it. I think the only downside is it's effectively yet another drafting game. I already have Quadropolis, Sagrada, and probably will have Azul at some point. This isn't as good as any of those, but there is something very lovable about how much more wacky this is from a gameplay perspective. Do I need another entry level drafting game? Definitely not. But hey, if I get it for cheap or trade, who am I to argue?"
246192,6.0,calbond,"Similar to Potion Explosion, but doesn’t use the marble gimmick nearly as effectively. Should have had some spatial-interlocking-puzzle aspect to the gizmos themselves. Still, would try again. Definitely overhyped here at Gen Con."
246192,8.5,Camdaddy08,Was not expecting much from this game. I was wrong. Demoed it at Gen Con and ended up purchasing it. The play is so smooth. The marble dispenser gimmick works well for this engine builder.
246192,7.0,CameronWLucas,"Good, but felt a little too complex for what it was. Trying to build my engine was fun but overall it just felt a little too opaque. Kind of like how I felt about Century Spice Road vs Splendor. Splendor is just so elegant, most of these other games just feel needlesly complex compared to a game like Splendor :/"
246192,7.0,CameronWLucas,Fun little themeless engine builder.  It's a bear to learn because of the iconography which is a shame because I think it would shine with light gamers. The marbles are pretty cool too.  Honestly I think I prefer the simplicity of something like Splendor though.

246192,8.5,cbazler,"Really fun little engine builder filler, perfect for the end of an evening of gaming, although we've found it to be so fun that it can be played multiple times in a row.    The combos are really rewarding, and allow for different approaches each game. Sometimes you get an amazing ""File/Build"" combo, which incentivizes you to build from your Archive instead of from the center of the table. Other games, you might develop a poweful ""Pick"" action and choose to spend more of your turns doing that. It's neat.  Thankfully, unlike Potion Explosion (which has a similar marble dispenser), the setup and take-down for this is much faster and easier. Definitely a keeper for us."

246192,6.0,chaddyboy_2000,"I love engine building games, so I was predisposed to liking this one, and it delivered! I just really enjoy games where you start with nothing, and slowly build up abilities and synergies that allow you to take more powerful actions as the game goes on.  This is a good entry-level engine building game, as all of the card powers are simple, but the trick is putting things together in the right combination to put together a powerful machine.  As a seasoned gamer, I will say this game does fall into one of my pet peeves for games: the illusion of a large variety of cards. There really aren't that many unique powers or abilities on this game, as many of the cards are the same ability, just replicated 4 times in each of the 4 colors of resources or buildings. While the game is still fun, I personally enjoy more varied abilities in my engine-builders, but I also understand it would take away from some of the simplicity here.  Overall, if you like engine builders, grab it, particularly if you're looking for a simple one that still packs a punch."
246192,7.0,chaoshawk,"Nice engine builder that has a great twist using random marbles as an energy mechanism.  Definately a tep up from Splendor, and offers some unique challenges to the players."

His previous entries (Imhotep and Barenpark) were very good entries but this one goes beyond those two. This is a tableau builder which rewards good planing with great combos. If planned out correctly and you manage to pull off combos there is that very satisfying feeling you get from playing a good board games...you all know that ah-ha moment. This game has plenty of them. Highly recommended."
246192,6.0,chillenniumfalcon,"Pretty dry engine builder. That's literally all you're doing: adding things that let you add more things. It's like Kingdomino, in that it feels like a filler that would be a good mechanic in a more complex game."

246192,8.0,CHRISDH,*8* (10+ Plays) A very close relative to Splendor. This one involves creating a tableau of cards(Gizmos) to create combos and chain reactions. It's a pretty good engine builder for the family or a filler. My family loves to play it and it sees quite a bit of play. The gum ball looking dispenser is totally a gimmick but it works.
246192,7.0,Chrisrob,The marbles make this more fun ...
246192,5.0,Chrono12,"I would describe this game as ""Splendor with extra steps."" The base gameplay is very similar to splendor, but it is not nearly as streamlined and there's a lot more you have to keep track of."
246192,7.0,Chuie,Cute little engine building game. I quite like it rules overhead is a bit higher than the amount and simplicity of the actual gameplay itself. 
246192,7.0,ciggie,"Clever engine builder with a marble gimmick for your resources that makes the game a bit different and fun. Normally you can pick a marble from one of the six that come out the chute, but special gizmos also let you pick blind from the top. I like this better than Potion Explosion because of the cool combos you can pull off by converting 1 marble into different/multiple marbles, and then the combos you can chain together when you take 1 of the 4 main actions. Iconography is fairly clear and the game is pretty easy to explain which is nice. I did find it odd we did not really use the research action, but I guess that comes from knowing the cards a bit better than we all did on our first play.   Another play and it just feels a bit too simple, no real cool actions (typically just more marbles, convert marbles, or gain a couple of points). Games like Splendor, Century Spice Road, and Dice Forge do this genre better but the marbles do make it unique. I'm not sure how much staying power this has, but for how quick it plays it may stick around a little longer."

The marbles and the device that dispenses them are not necessary to the game (could have accomplished the same thing with tokens and a bag) but they add a flair that I will admit did increase my enjoyment level."

246192,7.0,Corsairs,"Like a marriage of ""Splendor"" and ""Potion Explosion,"" ""Gizmos"" is a colorful blast of strategic engine-building. Start your engine with a few basic gizmos, then build up to the mid-levers, working to activate combos with your complete gizmo stable. The game lacks ""Splendor's"" simple elegance, yet it makes up for that with greater strategic consideration. Fun, but a little too slight for me to want to play often.

246192,8.0,Darfka,"""Combo the game"". I simply adore figuring out combo in games; I played a lot of Magic during College for that reason (and that's also why my preferred board game genre are deck-building and engine-building).   This game is quite similar to splendor on some aspects but the combo aspect is what I really like about it.  Almost each guizmos (cards) that you buy improve your 4 possible actions (pick, search, archive, build) during your turn.  What's interesting is that most of the time, you will be able to build chain reactions where one action will lead to multiple others.  Ex: building a black guizmos      -> since you built a black guizmos, you can pick another resource of your choice: pick blue resource      -> since you picked a blue resource, you can now pick another random ressource  It's quite a simple and short game (people really gets it after one game usually) but, at the same time, the chain reactions you can provoke are really satisfying. I would love love love for that game to get some expansions otherwise there's not that much novelty from one game to the other after a while."
246192,5.0,darkbanan,"Cool marble gimmick, unfortunately the game is mediocre at best. Lot's of better engine builders out there."
246192,8.0,darker,"It's action chaining: the card game! I enjoy that sort of thing, and appreciate that this one seems resistant to hyperfocusing: in one game, a player managed to get out a bunch of early cards that highly rewarded Archiving cards then building them from his Archive, and we thought he had the game in the bag... but all the rewards were similar, which meant he couldn't actually make good (or any) use of all of them. My engine took easily 2-3x as long to come online, but was much more robust - I was able to build a new Gizmo nearly every turn.  The central gimmick - the marble pit - was fun and worked well. What we chose to build was informed at least somewhat by game context - e.g., during early-to-mid-game, we had a very strong streak of Yellow marbles and a very strong streak of no Yellow gizmos. And the limits on marbles/archived cards/cards looked at with the Research(?) action were a neat form of upgrade that we always cursed not having built the turn before.  The presentation was also really good - having the separate areas for each type of trigger made it a *lot* easier to manage/understand your engine.  My primary concern is longer-term replayability; there's only a modest number of Gizmo types. Having a wider variety and/or some other source of game-to-game variance (e.g., objectives) would give it a boost."
246192,8.0,darthservo,"Use energy to obtain and power gizmos that will combine with others to make even more energy!  Satisfying combos are aplenty as players collect and use colored plastic marbles to try and build their engines up toward victory.  Recommend 2-4 players  Good: * Fast turns help get to combo-building quickly. * Different paths to specialize in each game. * Reaching in the dispenser for marbles.  Not so good: * Marbles are plastic, which admittedly helps on weight. * Uninteresting artwork. * Sometimes marbles get stuck in the feeder on their own."

246192,7.0,deedw,"Wer die Murmelbahn von „Gizmos“ sieht, wird sich gleich an „Potion Explosion“ erinnert fühlen. Bei „Gizmos“ handelt es sich aber in meinen Augen um das einfachere und bessere Spiel.  Jeder Spieler kann in seinem Zug eine von vier Aktionen auswählen: Eine Karte aus der Auslage nehmen und speichern, eine Karte bauen, eine farbige Murmel nehmen oder vom verdeckten Stapel Karten ziehen und ggf. dann etwas davon bauen oder speichern. Das war's! Die gebauten Karten werden mit den Murmeln bezahlt. Und einmal gebaut verbessern sie die vier Aktionen, sodass man für den Bau weitere Murmeln zufällig oder gezielt ziehen kann. Und so spielt man vor sich hin, bis ein Spieler 16 Karten vor sich hat und das Spiel endet. Die Karten bringen dann Siegpunkte.  Das Thema sucht man bei „Gizmos“ auch wieder vergebens. Dass ich „Gizmos” (Maschinen) mit Energiekugeln erstelle, spielt einfach keine Rolle. „Karte“ und „Murmel“ tut es als Begriff auch. Davon abgesehen spielt es sich sehr nett und schnell. Wir waren in knapp 30 Minuten fertig. Sehr befriedigend ist die immer besser ineinander greifende Engine (wenn man keinen Fehler macht), wodurch bei den Aktionen immer mehr Bonus abfällt. Es ist aber auch nicht extrem tiefschürfend, meist ist es recht klar, was man in seinem Zug an sinnvollen Aktionen machen kann und muss nur eine davon auswählen."

Then the game is very simple, choose one of the 4 possible actions and then apply the potential benefits from the gizmos you already built. This game is very simple and a great gateway to learn engine building, the only downside is for the first 2 games, there are lots of icons to remember, but once this done the turns are very quick with a low downtime. I really recommend this game to discover the engine building mecanism !"
246192,6.0,Destrio,Pros:  + Fun tactile game with the plastic colorful marbles  Cons: - Replayability is low as what you do in the game is largely the same between plays. Highly tactical. - First edition cardboard marble dispenser can lose some marbles that fall out of the bottom and are not found until the game is over. - Highly abstracted theme. - It would be a great family game but it has a few concepts that are a bit foreign to newbies and at the same time rather simplistic for gamers.

It's especially appealing to me as I am an experimental physicist and a big Phil Walker-Harding fan (Bärenpark, Imhotep, Sushi Go, Cacao, Archaeology). The game has a nice arc: an initial slow build of Gizmos to a thrilling cascade of triggering effects. It taps that same euphoria that Ganz Schön Clever has for me recently.  The manual is absolutely excellent. The iconography is very good and I am impressed with the clarity of the game space as the Gizmos build - choices and actions are clear. The game ends at a good point, just when it starts becoming a challenge to track the triggering Gizmos.  The marble dispenser is itself an excellent, elegant gizmo. It keeps the pick and draw actions snappy. And it makes an attractive table presence! Using a deck of cards or a bag of chits in its place would have been a fiddly mess."
246192,8.0,DutchOrange,"Great game, plays well with 2, 3 or 4 players. Multiple strategies, great depth, plays in under 1 hour."
246192,6.0,Dynastico,I like engine-buildy tableau builder games.  But is it still good on repeated plays?  I had no difficulty creating my ideal engine on the first try.

246192,6.0,eddy_sterckx,2022-07-20 : First play. Played this back in June and forgot to type up some comments about it. It's an ok game/engine builder but in an age of many really good engine builders it just doesn't shine.

246192,6.0,eldooderino,"Is fun, a little needlessly complex in the sheer number of elements you have to keep track of for me."
246192,9.0,Eleara0720,"We've had this game for a couple years after it was recommended to us by our local FLGS. For some reason, I was suspicious of it and didn't want to learn it. I enjoy other machine building games, but for some reason, I just didn't think this one would speak to me.   I was so, SO wrong.   I've only played twice, so I am definitely still learning the best way to fit everything together, but it's been a great learning experience. The mechanics are simple enough that you can sit down and learn and play quickly, but you still have to use enough logic and resource budgeting that it doesn't feel like a complete throw away to play.   My biggest suggestion: Don't sleep on the upgrades or conversions! The points get higher much easier when you can combo your purchases and purchase level three cards earlier on.   One of the biggest things I appreciated was the thought that went into the components. They gave us round currency, so they also gave us a ring to contain them. There is a blind selection option and directed selection option, so they designed and included a bank that could handle both. The provided a boxed that can actually hold all the stuff they give you to play with. Box mechanics are one of my greatest pet peeves, so I always appreciate when it's well thought out.   My only real concern is replayability. There are no expansions for this game. We do have the promo pack, but that's just a few cards, and it doesn't seem to add a ton. Unless more content appears, I worry that this game won't hold its luster. Especially when playing with 3 or 4 people, it's easy to burn through a big chunk of the level one and two cards. I would love to see where else this game could go."
246192,5.0,Electropuncher,"I didn't have fun with this one, but I can see the appeal. Basically, if you want to have to worry about twenty triggers, this is the game for you."

246192,8.0,enigma0t2,- This absolutely replaces Splendor for me. The game really is about creating an engine that allows you to chain moves together. Easy to teach and quick to play!
246192,7.5,EnumahElish,"nice quick engine-building. Theme weak, and the energy (marble) hopper a bit of a gimmick. At least it doesn't overshadow the nimble, interesting game play. I like this a lot, and because of its light, quick nature, can see it being played regularly when we have an extra 30 - 45 minutes."
246192,7.0,enzo622,"The foundation of the game is buying bonus power cards and building your own bonus power engine. The way you do that is by paying for the cards with marbles. You select the marbles from a tray of marbles on offer. Red, blue, yellow, and black marbles each build their respective color card types.  The cards do everything from helping you select more marbles with a single action, hold more marbles (you’re initially limited to 5 which makes the bigger cards impossible to buy), and use marbles more efficiently, for colors beyond their own, etc.   It plays quickly and is a quarter-drop game. Had a bad game of it? Drop another quarter and have a go. It’s short enough to play a few back to back."
246192,7.4,EpicViking,"2019-11-10 The game is okay, but perfect as a gateway game for non-gamers. "
246192,7.0,epp55,"So much alike and at the same time very different from, Splendor. Its fun and quirky and more of an engine builder than Splendor, where tactful maneuvers give players a more deep gameplay.  But even if its not deep, its a very enjoyable game."

246192,4.0,erikclaes1981,Wrongfully compared with potion explosion. It's like comparing Kingsburg with monopoly because it has dice. In this equation gizmos would be the monopoly... Building the combos is never excited and I was actually happy the game ended. Takes way to long for a seemingly filler game. The cardboards look like poor quality.
246192,8.0,Esredi,"Después de pasarme un año escuchando ""este es como el Gizmos"", mi decisión fue ""Saca el Gizmos de una vez y así lo pruebo"" (Quizá no fueron esas las palabras exactas,... ni el sentimiento... Pero sí el mensaje).  Es un juego divertido y fácil. Lo mejor que tiene es que es impredecible, porque según lo vas movimiendo o escogiendo, se va modificando la situación, lo que hace que no puedas gestionar los recursos como quieras. Pero aquí vienes a hacer combos y ganar. Y a pasarlo bien, tambien. Y en este juego (mejor a tres, mínimo), está más que asegurado."

246192,6.0,EvilPolBro,"Well designed card drafting, race to score the most points game with interesting decisions. I would not play in a highly competitive group due to potential AP abuse. The game could use a method to track the number of total cards and level III cards in play by a each player."

246192,7.5,ewhalen01,Teng
246192,5.0,exparrot,"Gosh this plays fast and it actually feels more like a race than an engine builder. You attempt to build a machine of 15 parts and each piece you add allows you to do more with one type of the basic actions.  Once you are playing it is pretty straight forward and easy to play, but the iconography could have been much better and often we had to refer to the cheat sheet over and over for very similar effects.  The marble mechanic here is actually pretty good. All of us were concerned it was simply a gimic but the game has two specific mechanics  for the marbles, picking from those in view and blind draw, of course this could have been achieved in other ways but honestly I quite like the dice 'machine' here,  I do however have concerns over replayability. Is there actually any more depth or any other mechanics to explore that we did not encounter in the first play?"
246192,6.0,ExplodingSnail,"Good game, but as a puzzle it can be solved quite quickly. You ideally want to be building a gizmo every round so whomever buffs their build action the most usually wins."
246192,7.0,e_tres,"Otro de esos juegos para introducir a no jugones o para jugar con toda la familia.

Comentários: Jogo muito gostoso de jogar e bem rápido! As regras não são complexas, mas a estratégia de combar as cartas exige bastante do jogador. O jogo chama muita atenção pela arte em 3D dos componentes, já o tema não é nada atrativo No jogo precisamos construir o melhor motor possível, para isso temos que comprar cartas de maneira que as habilidades dela se combinem para deixar o seu motor cada vez mais potente.

246192,9.0,Falex2000,I really like how the game turns more interesting in each round thanks to the cards and modifiers you acquire in each turn. High recommended
246192,7.7,familywontplay,"Most certainly of the Splendor/Ganymede genre.  Presently I like this one the most despite that the marbles are a total unnecessary gimmick and the marble dispenser has its occasional mechanical problems.    Played with 4 and no run away winners.  Everyone finished within a point of each other.  All of us had varied engines which we all established early in the game and advanced with satisfaction.  We all felt our different engines ran smoothly & choices were always available.    I am sure many will complain & rate it low because there is no interaction, that it's just a game of solitaire for each player. However, I enjoy all kinds of games from high to low interaction, and found this one quite satisfying, as did all the others players."
246192,8.0,fargus9,This is the game I wanted Splendor and Century to be.
246192,5.0,Faso74it,"Tableau building, not my genre. The marble gimmick could have been just a deck of cards, but this is cmon, so overproducing is the key word. While it makes sense in potion explosion, here is nice but nothing noteworthy. The concatenation effects are nice, but get stale soon."
246192,3.0,FaytParkour,"No reason to play this if you have a game like Century: Spice Road (or Golem Edition) or any other good engine builder. Hardly any player interaction, so my friends and I weren't too impressed."
246192,7.0,Fencejummper,Family weight tableau builder. Wife enjoys it
246192,7.0,Fennecus,"First engine builder for us.  So many recommendations on forums.  Simple to learn, fun to play, yet quickly I find it a bore.  Marble dispenser is a good idea.  clever purchases gets lots of chain reactions.  Wish there was  few more marbles in dispenser or better yet make dispenser smaller."

246192,7.0,Flemeth,"Un Spendor like qui plaira aux amateurs de combos à gogo et de billes colorées. Je préfère l'épure de son aîné, le trouvant à la fois trop débordant de cartes à effet et trop autistique, car même s'il est possible de bloquer ses adversaires en leur piquant des cartes, on jouera la plupart du temps le nez dans ses billes à multiplier et démultiplier les effets possibles. Un jeu solo à plusieurs en quelque sorte, comme Res Arcana ou récemment Underwater cities, de bons jeux qui n'ont pas ma faveur pour la raison citée plus haut. Donc oui pour le côté ludique, non pour le côté fédérateur."
246192,7.0,flow wong,还可以，没有想象中好玩，有些杂乱，没有宝石那么简洁。本身是要打combo，但构筑起来的时候也差不多结束，而且打出combo的时候没有爽快感也没有成就感（不像大饭店）。可以玩，但重开欲望不高。
246192,7.0,flrecord,The aspect of engine building in this game is good for use as a gateway engine building game that is similar feel with Century Spice Road. Only complain of this game is it doesn't provide a counter component to help player track their amount of gizmos card they purchased. It's really important to tick the last round and tend to cause mistake (we found in serveral games that we have too many gizmos card in our board because we forgot to count it). My group prevent this issue by using wooden tokens to track amount of gizmos card we purchased.

246192,7.5,FuriousBroccoli,"Pretty abstract engine builder with novel marble feeder. Success seems to be gated by luck of the draw, though the combos and very satisfying."
246192,4.0,FuzzyLlamaReviews,"I like the engine building and the use of the marbles is nifty...BUT....the chain reaction combos (although sound awesome in design) are VERY boring in action. Almost all the chain reactions just allow you to grab more marbles or vp tokens. On top of that the playing area is really hard to monitor what you can even do. Since it's all going to be random with every game on what cards you end up drawing (although most of them do the exact same thing just under different colored marbles) it's always going to be a bit of a pain to look through all your placed cards to see what chain reactions you can do. This only increases as the game goes on as you get more cards down.   The beginning is SUPER slow and it takes a bit to build up...which is fine, I mean we are playing an engine builder here. It's just that.....I wish the chain reactions were more interesting. I wish there was more meat on these bones. Also, the plastic container that holds the marbles is pretty meh, always having to shake it to get more marbles to fall into the hole.   Overall it's not a ""terrible"" game but there are many other engine builders I would play over this such as Roll for the Galaxy or any of those ""Roll, Race, Frontiers"" types of games. Perhaps an expansion to add in some new, more interesting chain reactions or variety."
246192,7.0,Fuzzyps234,I like this engine builder.  Full disclosure though: I have scored awfully in my two plays.  I may be close to some semblance of a strategy for game three though.

246192,7.0,Gemelli23,"This engine-building game definitely reminds me of Potion Explosion for all the obvious reasons, but it also reminds me of San Juan in others -- being able to subtly and/or aggressively boost your base actions is a neat mechanic with more depth than I expected.

246192,8.43,georgeiosif90,I came to it with no expectations and it didn't disappoint. Solid engine building mechanics and it's fun drafting those colored balls. Keeper. 
246192,8.0,Germflinger,"I rather liked this one, though I am partial to engine building mechanics in games. Gizmos seems like Splendor with a new twist and to me this is a good thing. At first I thought the game might be bogged down by action resolution but it actually goes quite quickly. The only thing that held the game up was the research action where it can cause some downtime while a number of cards are looked through. However, I think that the time spent on this would decrease dramatically with more familiarity of the game. The artwork is nice and the iconography is easy to understand after a few minutes of play. Overall a good game that I would like to play again if I get the chance."

246192,9.0,GhostInside,"Fantastic engine-builder.  Cute, fast, easy to explain, easy for new players to pick it up. Most of the people I have introduced this game to have purchased it shortly afterwards. However, it IS extremely lightweight once you figure out how it works.  And that leads to the feeling that you have ""played out"" the game if sticking to rules-as-written. But once you start adding house rules (like taking the pure-VP cheese cards out of the deck) it starts getting interesting again."

246192,6.0,glax,"The design is a fine Splendor-like derivative, but combos are disappointing and rather flat because they mostly don't cross action boundaries. Individual actions get more powerful as gizmos are added, but they don't normally trigger other actions. Only a few level 3 gizmos do that, and the game is probably over before those make much of an appearance (the default game length of 16 total/4 level 3 gizmos feels too short; felt better at 20/5.)"

246192,9.0,glunsforddavis,A great engine building game that builds on games like Splendor but adds really interesting interactions. Your turns become more complex only as much as you make them more complex. It's just barely above a gateway and plays in maybe 45 minutes with 4 players.

246192,7.53,Godblin,There is a bit of early snow bowling due to luck.
246192,8.0,GoingTopShelf,"Phil Walker-Harding hits another home run for me and my family with Gizmos. The chaining effects in this game are pure awesomeness. The look on my son's face was pure joy when he built a gizmo that allowed him to take a pick action which allowed him to take another pick action, which allowed him to, etc. etc.  I worried that the chaining of effects would become overwhelming as you can only use the effect on each card once, but there's just enough going on where you feel super cool when you chain 3-4 things together, but rarely do those effects become difficult to track. I also love that good play is rewarded and there can be wide discrepancies in points. The negative of this is that the game can be exhilarating or deflating depending on how the game flows. This is a perfect mix of light enough for newcomers but strategic enough for hobbyists."

Not that this isn't the delightful sugar rush of an engine builder that it seemed, just that it hasn't yet TOTALLY gotten its hooks in us.

The play time is perfect for when you have a hour or less or just want something a little lighter. [Sleeved w/ Swan PanAsia]"
246192,5.5,H8Man,"Ok game, but I expected more. The game runs too fast to actually play with all the abilities available. You can go for cards that increase your pool of resources, but at the time you are ready to buy the bigger stuff, the game will already be in it's last turns."
246192,7.5,hadsot,"I think this game is a really good and simple engine building quite literally.  I think the choices in terms of draft are really important at beginning, and you might have an awful start, if you didn't plan a little bit ahead.   The only downside from the game for me is the slow beginning since, we are just picking and building the gizmos."

246192,7.0,horusz,"JEM Magazin 71. szám: Minden játékos kap egy energiatároló gyűrűt, egy műszertáblát és egy kezdő kütyükártyát. Az energiatároló gyűrű egy kör alakú karton elem, amely megakadályozza, hogy az ide kerülő golyók elguruljanak, és alapból 5 gömböt tárolhatunk benne. A műszertáblánk nagyon informatív, kevésbé gyakorlott játékosok is könnyen megértik általa a játék működését. Fel vannak rajta tüntetve a különböző kapacitásaink, illetve mind a 4 akció, amelyet végrehajthatunk. Ezek az alábbiak lehetnek:  Iktatás: Elvesszük az egyik felcsapott kütyükártyát az egyik sorból és iktatjuk, ami annyit jelent, hogy a műszer-táblánk mellé tesszük. Alapból az iktatási kapacitásunk 1, ezt fejlesztésekkel növelhetjük.  Felvétel: Elveszünk egy energiagömböt az energia-ada¬golóból, 6 golyó közül választhatunk, utána kigurul egy újabb.  Építés: Vagy elvesszük az egyik sorból az egyik kütyükár¬tyát, vagy egy korábban iktatott kütyüt építünk meg, mi-után kifizettük az építési költségeket.  Kutatás: Felhúzunk valamelyik pakliból annyit, amennyi a kutatási értékünk, és azokból egyet vagy azonnal megépí¬tünk, vagy iktatjuk.   A játék sava-borsát természetesen a kütyük adják. Minden kütyünek van egy típusa, és miután kifizettük a kártyát, a műszertáblánk megfelelő oszlopába kerül. A fejlesztő kütyük az energiatárolónk kapacitását, az iktatható kártyák maximális számát és a kutatási értékünket növelhetik. A váltók lehetővé teszik, hogy bizonyos típusú energiagömböket más fajtákként használhassunk építéskor. A többi kütyü az első három akció egyikéhez kapcsolódik. Amikor az adott akciót a kütyün feltüntetett módon végrehajtjuk (pl. elveszünk egy kék golyót, vagy megépítünk egy sárga kütyüt, vagy iktatunk egy kártyát, stb.), akkor az a kütyü aktiválódni fog és ad nekünk valamilyen bónuszt (pl. húzhatunk egy random golyót a tárolóból, kapunk egy győzelmi pontot, stb.). És itt jön a lényeg, hiszen az egyik kártya bónuszaként kapott akció lehet, hogy egy másik kártya aktiválási feltétele, így egészen szép láncolatok jöhetnek létre a megfelelő akció kiválasztásával. Az egyetlen szabály az, hogy egy kártyát egy körben csak egyszer lehet aktiválni, így végtelen ciklusok nem jöhetnek létre a játékban.  A játék akkor ér véget, amikor valaki megépíti negyedik III. szintű kütyüjét, vagy összesen 16 kütyüje nem lesz. Ekkor összeadjuk az összes kütyünk pontszámát, illetve a játék közben szerzett győzelmi pontokat, és a legtöbb ponttal rendelkező játékos lesz a győztes.  A Kütyük egy könnyen tanulható, viszont annál több lehetőséget biztosító, kitűnő kombózós játék. A láncreakciók létrehozása nagy sikerélményt ad mindenkinek. Első játékaink során sokszor bosszankodtunk, hogy nem a megfelelő színű kártyák vannak felcsapva, ezért nagy a szerencsefaktor a játékban, illetve nem értettük, miért jó a Kutatás akció. Pont ezzel az akcióval van ellensúlyozva az, hogy a színek korlátozzanak minket, ezt is megoldották a tervezők. A 14 éves korhatár ne riasszon el senkit, az amerikai piac miatt van megadva, ez egy könnyed, mégis gondolkodtató, élvezetes játék a fiatalabbak számára is.  "
246192,8.0,Howlsthunder,"This game is the ""Splendor-killer"" for me. It is structured very similarly to Splendor but adds meat to the bone. Instead of buying jewels to have more jewels to buy more jewels, you're buying gizmos (via marbles) to get more gizmos that make the marbles more valuable/dynamic. Plus, Gizmos is a very tactile game-- MARBLES. :)"
246192,8.0,hughthehand,"This is a great engine building game. Production is great, feels like there are tough choices, and doesn't feel like there is ever a runaway winner. Researching was ignored for the first couple of games. Way more important than it seems. Out of five games, no one won by having 4 of the tan cards, always by points. I believe this to be because I have only played it 4 player. I think that will happen more with two. I think this game will most likely be great at any amount of players."

246192,7.0,iadena,Splendor + Potion Explosion So the demo copy at a store and the components are bad. The marbles are plastic. However they do work and I like the engine building aspect. It seem that there is a huge luck factor in your engine due to the drawing of the marbles and cards.  The person who show us the game said that the average score is 18 which 2 of the players in my game achieved.  However the other 2 got 2x that score and was in the 30's.  So I don't really need this in my collection as I have other engine building games and potion explosion. It is a good and fun game.

246192,6.0,Indexspartan,Decent game. The engine building is good but some gizmos are clearly more useful than others even when  comparing within tiers of gizmos. Also have yet to see someone beat the strategy of rushing tier 1 gizmos as the research action makes it nearly impossible effectively deny an opponent their desired color. The marble holder can also be somewhat finicky.

It's fun trying to get just the right upgrades you need in order to succeed and come out on top at the end of the game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is particularly  interested in science and engineering, as individuals ultimately have to design a system that will allow them to come out victorious at the end of the game. That being said, this game is not complicated and I would still recommend it to all my friends. "
246192,8.0,jbfps116,"rating after one play: Quite fun, had to help some other players see all the chain reactions they made... We played this shortly after playing Lorenzo il Magnifico the Card Game and the two seemed rather similar but Gizmos has more rewards as you play while the other rewards deeper strategy. Not sure I need both in my collection but likely that won't change haha"
246192,5.5,jblomquist,"Structurally it's a lot like Splendor, but there are a bunch of different card effects, fewer available cards, fewer available resources to grab, and a much lower limit on your reserve of resources, all of which make the game much more random. And it's longer. I don't really see the appeal at all. It seems like there's not nearly enough opportunity for better and worse play, any of that will get completely drowned out by the randomness. No reason to play this over plenty of other light, quick engine builders that offer more interesting decisions."
246192,7.5,jdave008,"Super streamlined engine builder. Simple to teach with pretty minimal time investment. Very fun to see what kind of engine you can get going. Gizmos designers did a great job with providing just enough information available to the player (i.e. cards of each level and 6 marbles to pick from) to help a more experienced player make a ""calcated"" decision on what to do. Highly suggest if you enjoy light/medium engine builders."

246192,4.0,jgoyes,"2019-07-29  Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2019)  I have never liked an original game from Cool Mini or Not, so I wasn’t expecting much from Gizmos and my expectation was met. Gizmos can be a good family game but it´s not for me.  Gizmos´ rules are easy to learn and each. You can teach the game under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 75 minutes.  The game´s components are very good as is usual from CMON. Gizmos has a cool gimmick, in this case, a marble dispenser, that is pretty useful, but it´s a gimmick nonetheless. The same result could have been done by drawing enough marbles out of a bag, but that´s not CMON´s way and, I confess, it´s cool to have very good looking gimmicks in your games. The rest of the components are ok. The art is ok as well.  The theme is exciting, cool and novel BUT you don´t really feel it during the game :(. When I bought Gizmos, for some unknown reason I thought it was something like TIM (The Incredible Machine), a mechanical physics puzzle but it not. Gizmos is an engine builder game.  Gameplay isn’t exciting for me as he decisions needed to play the game are rather obvious. Each turn you have to choose one action from 4 available:  • File: Allows you to save a card from the ones available for future construction.  You have an initial limit of 1 card but that can be expanded with other cards.  • Pick:  Allows you to take marbles (resources) from the available ones to build the cards. You have an initial limit of 5 marbles but that can be expanded with other cards.  • Build: Allows you to build cards from the display (obviously) or from the one you got with the File action. To build you need to play the correct marbles.  • Research: Allows you to draw a certain amount of cards from the decks and you can File/Build them.  Every time you take an action you also need to see which bonuses you have from your constructed cards (thus the engine part of the game). You are trying to chain/combo as most effects as you can. As you can see, the game is fairly easy ruleswise and choosing the best option for you isn’t very hard.   I feel the game has a considerable luck factor with the cards (high luck) and the marbles (moderate luck) . There are ways to mitigate it, but it´s present.   Replayability seems high because there are lots of cards but many of them seem very similar, I would need more plays to verify this but I don’t think I will play more Gizmos.  For me, Gizmos is at the same level of Potion Explosion. Both are very cool looking games, but shallow in the decisions department. On the same topic I also don´t like Splendor or Century and all three games share some mechanisms.   Bottom line, Gizmos is a good family game, but it´s not for me. I crave heavier experiences and Gizmos offer easy decisions in a very good looking package. I feel the luck of the draw can easily decide who wins. The game bores me a bit. I will sell it ASAP.  Current Rating : 4.0"
246192,7.5,jgunnz,"The system is clever. Use energy marbles to power ""gizmos"" and create chain reactions with other gizmos.  There are only 4 actions, ""pick"", ""build"", ""research"", and ""file"" - research is rarely used thus, there are really only 3 actions . . . so the combos are somewhat limited as a result. I am looking forward to potential expansions that can add upon this clever system. Right now this is a lightweight entry level game in the same vein as Splendor. With some expansions it might hit more of a sweet spot but definitely a solid game as is."

246192,8.0,joetweber,A family favorite. My kids love the engine-building and the tactile nature of the marbles. I love the approachable yet satisfying engine-building and the simplicity of each turn (only 4 actions) makes this game easy to introduce to new and experienced gamers alike.
246192,7.0,joewyka,"Gizmos feels like a game for people who enjoy Splendor, but want there to be more to it than just trading gems for cards ever more efficiently. That's also essentially what you are doing in Gizmos, but rather than cards just giving you energy of a certain color, they enhance your actions. Enhanced actions can potentially grant additional actions which in turn can be modified to grant other actions. Late in the game, you can have some pretty big turns! The basic actions are the same as in Splendor - File (Reserve a Card), Pick (Take an Energy), and Build (Buy a Card) - with the addition of a new action: Research (Draw x cards from the top of a face down deck and build or file one). Like in Splendor, the available cards are tiered in three levels with escalating costs, benefits and points. The game ends when a player's tableau has 16 cards or 4 top tier cards. A full 2-player game can be played in 20-30 minutes, with maybe 10-15 minutes added per additional player.  One aspect that I'm not sure I like as much as Splendor is that you have six randomly available energy colors at any given moment, which makes that aspect of the game less planful than with Splendor. This is offset by purchasing cards that can mitigate some of this risk by converting one energy to two or giving you the ability to exchange one color for another. It is less difficult to buy cards in Gizmos as the game focuses much more on building cool combos than striving for valuable and expensive cards. Energy is represented by marbles which are dispensed from a large marble machine, making the box much larger than the game play really warrants. I don't know about this one. It's enjoyable, but I think I can get just as much enjoyment from other engine builders in a MUCH smaller box."

I lost the last game I played but still had a great couple turns using my combo machine.   If you like trying to build combos in games, even if you aren't super big into lighter or luck-influenced games, definitely give this one a try.   Edit: Not just hot on it right now. I regularly think about and bring out Gizmos to play and will always think of this as the better Splendor. As I said originally, it is fun to play and that is huge. "

246192,8.0,Karujin,Like this game but after a couple plays it felt the game progressed the same way. Variable player powers might have helped combat that feeling.

246192,8.0,kaszkiet,"2018-11-27 - 8.5 - what a surprise! Easy, addictive, fun game with nice, but not overcomplicated combos. It's great from the very beggining.  2018-12-29 - 8.5->7.5 - after more plays it's still really good, but the first impression was great. In collection still, an excellent game to play with 3 people in 40 minutes.  2020-01-18 - 7.5->8 - a pleasure to play. Just a very good game."

246192,5.0,kegz,"Tableau builder game where you do a bunch of things on your turn that nobody else at the table pays attention to. The temptation is to say this is better than Splendor because Gizmos gives you the feeling that you're building some sort of engine, but Gizmos is ultimately no more satisfying and just prolongs the time you must spend not actually interacting with the people you are ostensibly playing a game with.  The cardboard marble dispenser is cool."
246192,6.0,Keithchan,"Japanese ver, is much more better than other version, because the base is used with plastic."
246192,8.0,kekiiwi,"Buena mecánica de juego, engine builder. Mientras más cartas compres, más posibilidades tienes de ganar, eso sí, debes comprar con cuidado y tener cuidado de quienes están comprando más cartas, aun cuando sean de menor valor.  Los componentes son de buena calidad también."

246192,8.0,kennethtwk,"A competitve, engine-building game where players work to build weird and wacky machines to get your combos chained and moving.  I have the 2nd Edition, which is arguably the better option with the energy balls klik-klaking down the pipe, a satisfying sound to hear, though admittedly it does get stuck often and we end up shaking it to get the next ball to drop every turn or so.  I think the end game objectives are arbitrary, and decisions and simple to pin down once you understand what’s on the board and strategize early.  My wife likes it because she can always see what she needs to do. The decisions are simple and she doesn’t need to think so many steps ahead. She likes this game better than Wingspan (blasphemous, I know) because there are more options available at one time, referring to the field of Gizmos and research options.  End game is around 35 points for 2, 3, and 4 players for multiple games I’ve played, so if you’re in the ballpark, you’re doing well."

246192,7.0,Kent,Not a bad engine building game.  Would definitely play again.  The marble dispensing apparatus is a bit gimmicky - a bit overproduced.  I'm sure there would be a way to produce it so that it wasn't so big and consume less space.

246192,7.25,Kghetto,"If you take Splendor, and Potion Explosion and melted them together you get Gizmos. Fun little engine building game with clever mechanics using the marbles. One gripe is that once someone gets a good engine going there is absolutely no way to catch up.   Still it is great for what it does.  "
246192,8.3,killertwinsfan,Very under-rated engine builder. You can really get going once you get your cards all working together. Some of the interections might confuse newer players. Game could maybe use a tweak on following the flow of your engine

246192,8.25,Klausi300,8.25
246192,8.0,knewaccount1,"Gizmos is an excellent engine builder that works great with a group of 3-4 players. The cards used to upgrade your engine feels very much like a 'rogue-like' indie game. This I believe is the most entertaining aspect of the game. Seeing the cards that have been dealt and making the best of it to try and win.  Although there is a clear win condition, winning or losing is not really the point of the game. You can have fun regardless of winning or losing. The fun comes form building as an efficient of a machine as possible. Build variety adds to the replayability. Combine build variety with random cards and you have a game that is always different each time you play. Hence the rogue-like comparison."
246192,8.0,koriakin,"Fast, simple, engaging! Prefer 2-3 over 4 players - since in 4p game cards switch to fast for my taste and you wait for your turn a little too long(depends on group I guess). Rating went down from 9 -> 8 after initial delight."

246192,6.0,KRWoods1,"A simple concept well-executed.  However, this game has my least favorite feature - constant counting.  You are constantly counting how many cards each person has in order to see if the game is close to ending.  This ruins a good deal of the fun, unfortunately."
246192,8.0,KubaP,A very fun opportunity game of combo crafting and tableau building.
246192,6.1,kvidhani,Combo chaining is fun!  However there are several problems in the new edition:  1. Marbles get stuck easily 2. Insert is atrocious  3. Game gets repetitive quickly  4. Marble luck is frustrating   If someone offered I would play but as it stands this can be safely avoided. Much better combo/engine builders out there even at this weight.
246192,8.0,kyokorebit,"Simple & addictive. Love it!  The design is so clean, both in mechanic and presentation. I would love to have bigger & thicker cards though."

246192,5.5,Lapsus,"I was expecting more.  The box looks great, the marble dispenser was intriguing and I love Walker-Harding.  But Gizmos is ultimately a simple tableau & engine building a la splendor with unattractive visuals & dry gameplay.  There's a significant luck component with the choices being entirely tactical and almost no strategy.  The marble gimmick is cute but ultimately unnecessary.  There's lots of 'mechanics' and iconography with make play slightly more complex than splendor for no real benefit, and I'm not a fan of splendor (which I think is that game that plays itself).  Anyway, I love Walker-Harding but this one falls flat."

246192,7.0,larryjrice,FIRST IMPRESSION:  Enjoy this one although there can be overpowered combos if the players allow them to occur - or at least that was one experience. Plays very quickly and you do want to focus pretty quickly if possible for maximum chain reaction benefits.
246192,6.5,Lawster,"A good puzzle game to set up combos and get your engine running. The plastic marbles are nice. I like the bubbles inside to give the marbles visual texture. The theme is meh though. Feels like I'm back in grad school with all of the ""filing"" and ""research"" going on. A better theme and artwork would have upped my rating. Iconography is good on the cards, although the attempt at using color blind symbology is a waste and confusing for new players since the marbles don't have the same symbols on them."

246192,5.5,Lecaro,"In ""Gizmos"" erfinden wir recht sinnlose Maschinen, die wiederum Maschinenteile herstellen für weitere sinnlose Maschinen, um so eine Maschinerie aufzubauen, die zum Sieg führt...  Wer an der Reihe ist, wählt eine aus vier Aktionen: 1. Speichern: Einen Gizmos, also eine Maschine (Spielkarte) aus der zentralen Auslage wählen und in den eigenen Speicherbereich legen. 2. Sammeln: Eine aus sechs zur Verfügung stehenden Energiemurmel - das Baumaterial des Spiels -  herausnehmen und im eigenen Vorrat lagern. 3. Bauen: Einen Gizmos aus der mittleren Auslage oder dem eigenen Speicher in einen Slot des eigenen Tableaus bauen, um damit Fähigkeiten zu verstärken: Mehr Murmeln und Karten lagern, Murmelfarben tauschen für einen vereinfachten Bau, beim Ausführen einer Aktion verschiedene Bonies erhalten, etc. 4. Forschen: Gizmos Karten von einem Stapel ziehen und eine davon speichern oder bauen. Nachdem ein Spieler eine bestimmte Anzahl Karten in der eigenen Auslage hat, endet das Spiel und Punkte werden gezählt. Je teurer die Gizmos' waren, desto mehr Punkte bringen sie. Wer die meisten Punkte sammeln konnte, gewinnt.  Ich konnte ""Gizmos"" auf der SpielDoch Messe testen und es konnte mich überhaupt nicht überzeugen. Ressourcen sammeln, damit Maschinen bauen und wieder von vorne. Nachdem ich zu einer weiteren, und diesmal vollständigen Partie überredet wurde, kann ich nun etwas besser den Spielreiz verstehen, den dieses Spiel bietet. Um den Sinn zu verstehen, ist eine geschickte Auswahl an Maschinenkarten nötig, um damit die beste Synergie aus dem Gesamtkonstrukt herauszuholen. Nehme ich einfach irgendetwas - was ich mir gerade leisten kann - wird das kaum zu einem schnellen Sieg führen. Als sehr wichtig empfand ich die Flexibilität der Murmelfarben. Bin ich erst einmal unabhängig davon, baue ich eine Karte nach der Nächsten. Welche das sind, ist dann völlig egal. Hauptsache Punkte! Am Ende bleibt das Spiel auf sehr niedrigem Niveau. Obwohl die Fähigkeiten immer mächtiger werden, macht man doch jede Runde dasselbe. Das finde ich langweilig und doch könnte man mich vielleicht zu einer weiteren Partie überreden, wenn es keine bessere Alternative geben sollte."
246192,7.5,Leftyrea,"I wish this game was longer. Definitely house ruled a 3 card draft on level 1 gizmos. We end up with 3 keep 2 and discard the other. So technically we start with 3 including the original start gizmo. Then we play to 25 gizmos. The chain effect is the best part, so we enhanced what we love most. But the game is great as it is."
246192,8.0,legolasegb,"I really enjoy Gizmos. I like the randomness of the top-tier Gizmos. The game has a random element with the card flips, but gives you a lot of options to work around that. It's not very heavy, but you have to out synergize your opponents, so it does take some thought. A great filler game!"

246192,7.0,leolu1901,"An entry-level engine buidling game with really short game time and fancy components. It's satisfying, even exciting to see my engine working, no matter how simple it is. My wife liked it so much for a period that we have played 50+ games, which made it great value compared with other less often played games. Wiredly, the randomness and lack of interaction helps its replayability as we each try to break our own record(mine is 74 at the present).  However, my approach to the game really hasn't changed for some time, which is, in my opinion, a very big problem. "

These type of games always 'feel' fun to play due to their simple, addictive game play.  However, is there any real substance to this game?  After 2 plays, I'm not sure there is.  It was fun due to the rush you get from growing stronger as you play, but does it do anything significant enough to be worth owning?  At first glance, the abilities you could gain didn't appear to be that interesting and tended to be fairly repetitive.    I'll likely obtain a copy, at some point, but won't be rushing out to buy it."

246192,7.5,Markmasta,In many ways a better version of Splendor. I also like that the marbles are not just a gimmick but a better device to show order than cards. Your tableau can become a bit overwhelming and it is hard to really strategize on what cards to pick. 
246192,7.0,markmist,"At first this is a bit difficult to learn as there are A LOT of icons and it is a bit counter intuitive how they work, but once you get an engine going this is a fun game.  The marble contraption is fun and adds a wow factor to the physical presentation.  If the icons were improved or if there was more text to decipher them, I would bump the rating a full point.  2nd play - was ok, cards already starting to seem a bit samey.  Could use an expansion.  I realize I don't really care for the artwork. Lowered .5."

246192,8.3,mmculber,"This is the definition of an ""engine builder""!  Great game and use of marbles is fun.  You can build some really great combos.  "
246192,7.0,mnemonicuz,A nice and simple engine building game. The engine building aspects of it works really well. The gameplay is simple and solid. More cards and functionality would be amazing though. It needs more variation to avoid the same patterns in each game.

246192,7.0,MortisDarkblight,I find this game to be a great way to introduce newer gamers to engine builders and it's got an interesting enough game design to keep me from hating it.
246192,7.0,Mosher,Yes the marbles are a gimmick but it works well.  My family enjoys this one as it isn't too long and can be fun to get some great combos built.
246192,7.0,Mozzik,"A nifty little engine building game with fun components (read: Marbles).  It's simple to teach and play.  I do have a slight concern about the replayability of the game as many of the abilities seem derivative of each other (one for each color, slight variances of the same abilities etc)."

A kombózás ellenére pörgős, nem kell perceket várnom, amíg a másik köre véget ér. Egy apróbb hátránya talán a témája és a grafikai megvalósítása, bár legalább funkcionális. Hezitálok, de nem biztos, hogy felfér a polcomra a Splendor és Potion Explosion mellé, az itthoni csapatot ismerve. "

246192,8.0,neflight86,"Snappy engine builder where you are using your engine almost constantly as you build it. Symbols look more complex than they are. Entertaining and plays quickly, but some turns like research can drag when multiple upgrades fire off in succession and trigger other upgrades."

246192,6.8,notacceptable406,Won from DGM drawing.
246192,8.0,NowOrNever88,"First play. Tied 15 cards and VP with another then he had more energy cubes so he won but came second in a 4p in about an hour. Smidge disappointing. The energy row was all black a while which seemed just a smidge chance/random based as did drawing for Research actions. Had a very tiny smidge of trouble telling red and yellow when light came on it but mostly could tell the colors 99% fine. Seemed decent in planning and engine building but I'dve preferred less randomness (ex in Splendor always having the gems available). The iconography took some getting used to but was fine, and the different engines and actions were understandable and mostly fine but mainly the lack of planning of what was available to build and what gems I could pick hurt the experience a smidge. Theme is better than Wingspan birds but honestly didn't pay much attention to art and such, and he marbles seem a pain for getting lost or accidentally rolling around too. Played with 1st edition marble cardboard so they got stuck a smidge. Imo this should've been a simpler card game instead of the gimmick. Would've preferred more control in the card turnout and less of the random marbles or effects like 'pick random ? Marble blindly' but was still semi decent engine builder. 6/10  Played twice more at 3 player in about one hour per play. Kinda annoying to plan but did win twice at 30-40 pts range and can see a lot of different viable strategy plus the icons became more accustomed with plays and randomness of row was better mitigated with more picks or card synergy. Overall a better impression but compared to Splendor or Century Golem, I'm not sure I actually like this more. There's certainly more to think of and consider and was enjoyable, but there's no strong pull back and the feel of the engine building didn't actually feel more satisfying per se than Splendor or Century already. And Century itself was still just more ""fun"" imo. Though I do like this same with Splendor ish. One wish was the marble dispenser wasn't as tall to block vision and honestly wouldn't have minded just cards to condense the game a lot instead of marbles. But still a pretty decent engine building game. 7/10 now and wouldn't mind playing more but not craving to.  Plays: 6+ good and solid engine builder that's harder to master than Splendor and I think tighter too. Still annoyed at marbles but pretty good gateway+ game ish imo, bumping up score 8/10  edit also was thinking of the marbles and how they could be cards or cubes. Yes, that's true and it was like so during playtesting apparently. But someone pointed out the tactile feel of marbles, which I agree with plus the novelty of a dispenser. This also means no shuffling a deck of cards with a discard pile, and no need to pull cubes/cards out and slide them down like in other games (ex in Century you buy a card and slide others down - not a big deal of course but a marble dispenser actually does save that minor trouble). Sometimes the view can be obstructed which isn't good, but its fun and cute for the novelty, esp to people new to it, and a marble representing energy is fine. So I think I don't mind the marbles as much now. Still, a small portable version would've been fine too I think, but I disgress. Great fun engine builder, and I like its purity more than Wingspan too, and I don't actually think it has less depth honestly."

246192,6.0,OasisFlyer,"Not terrible but I generally love this type of puzzly engine builder. Wasn't impressed with the low number of satisfying chain reactions I was able to get though. My enjoyment of this game depends on what cards come out, which reminds me of why I didn't always like Spice Road."
246192,7.0,oatmeal1201,"Played once at Dice Tower Con 2018. This is like Splendor with crazy combos. This is not like potion explosion.   Basic gameplay is take marbles from the track and use them to build cards. Once you have your engine down, doing an action or playing a card can trigger another action, which can trigger another action, which could potentially...well, you get the idea. From what I remember, the game ends when 16 cards are built.   There are also three rows of cards which reminded me of Splendor. The easy to build, medium, and hard to build. You can also take and reserve cards.   Only played once but needs more plays to see what kind of cards are out there."

246192,7.0,Official Avem,"Fun, tactile game. Love the use of marbles as a resource because it sets it apart from other games. My major issue with Gizmos is that the cards which award VPs for building certain colours, combined with cards that allow you to take pick actions for building certain colours create a strategy that I have found to be too reliable. I find myself having to choose between making a fun engine which may not do well, or building the above strategy which will almost always win but is getting dull now."
246192,8.0,ojaidave,"Fantastic ratio of quality game experience to play time. A round can be played in 20 minutes, potentially, if players get a good engine going. A couple of cards can be game-breaking with the right combo, but that’s okay as you’ll be able to set back up and play another round in short order."

246192,10.0,Oleg_,"Unexpectedly fun and solid game. Bought it semi-blind but everyone in my family enjoyed it greatly. Building ""an engine"" and watching it producing balls of energy is very satisfying.  I only subtracted one point because there's no player interaction at all - the ""gizmos market"" should have added some interaction but after the game unfolds a little everyone is just using their Search ability, ignoring the market.  Actually, this game made me think about buying other games made by Phil Walker-Harding. I'm thinking about Barenpark, but we already have Patchwork, so I'm still on the fence.  Upd. Jan 2022: Upping the rating to 10. Enjoying every play of this."

246192,9.0,Orangerer,Splendor meets terraforming mars if it were simpler. Fun game with replay ability and endless different ways you can play and build. This will be a common game being played in our house. All that said the instruction manual is the worst part of this game. It does not make it clear how certain cards work. You need to watch how it’s played videos and ask questions in forums. IF we are playing it right it’s a great game......

246192,7.0,OrionHegemony,"Maybe too simple to be really great. Seems mostly tactical without any strategy. Could use some selected goals or shared goals or something. Still, the game seems fairly balanced and is fast, clever, and fun."
246192,7.9,Orphebus,"Building an engine is always fun to me, especially when you feel it improve at every step. Some combos are spectacular. I'm not sure about the balance of the cards, I have the impression that some ways are better than others, but I'm willing to try.  Not the best art/iconography. It needs a plastic marble dispenser, not a cardboard one."

246192,7.0,PBrennan,"The marbles with the dispenser provide some wow factor (but honestly could have just as easily been done with a deck of cards). Your turn is to collect a resource or buy a card with a power, adding it to your tableau. Eventually you'll build a little engine of complementary card powers where buying cards will either give you resources (ie the marbles), or allow you to convert resources into other colours, or provide discounts (and so on and so on). The faster you can buy, and the better cards you can buy, the more VPs. So yep, it's a nice engine building game. There’s the ability to claim/reserve a card if you’re desperate to have it as it’s not uncommon to have the card you covet “stolen” just before you’re ready to build - early on you can assess how safe you are because you can see what marbles people are collecting, but once the converter powers kick in, it’s all too hard. What's different from most purchase games is that the cards are mono-coloured rather than the usual mixed X blue / Y red / Z black to buy this card. This speeds the game up tremendously, but at the cost of railroading you into purchasing only the cards in the marbles of the colour you’re collecting (pending powers, etc). I both liked the upside and disliked the downside simultaneously. I’m happy to sit on the fence in the meantime, and to give it another whirl if someone pulls it out given its fast gameplay."
246192,7.0,PeleWebb,Found out the game ends at 4 level 3 cards OR 16 cards total.  Changed the game in a way none of us liked so we are going to just keeping playing so that the 4th level III card ends the game

246192,9.0,petza55,"As a scientist invent various gadgets (gizmos) to improve your engine and collect points. Similar to Splendor and Century but more interesting and deeper:  +The marbles and the dispenser are innovatively and eye-catching, compared to cards, tiles or other tokens. I really like the energy rings too. +It is very satisfying to build a good engine and trigger numerous gizmos in a single turn. +There are various strategies you can follow and they all seem interesting. Filling effects, picking effects, converters, mixed strategies etc. +It plays really fast, around 10-15 minutes per player. The set up and tear down also do not take much time. +The main actions are simple and easy to understand even for non-gamers.  -The dispenser seems quite sturdy. But it is still just cardboard and it will be damaged sooner or later. Especially the upper side is usually forced during random marble draws. -Really difficult to find sleeves that fit perfectly (67x67mm). -It is easy to forget a gizmo that you triggered during your turn. In late game, there may be a little too many effects to keep track of. -A couple of times during each play the marbles will stuck into the dispenser and you have to shuffle them with your hand to make them fall. -The gizmos art is a little blunt. I would prefer even more vibrant colours, like eg. power grid deluxe factories."
246192,6.0,pfctsqr,"A bit too derivative.  The marbles could easily be replaced by cubes without any change to the gameplay, but then it probably would not get noticed.  My one play was fun, but I don't care whether or not I will play it again and I definitely will not purchase it.  Also, many of the components feel cheap.  The small player board ""strips"" are warped and started coming apart after only a couple of plays and it does not appear that the marble dispenser will hold up all that long."

246192,7.0,Phrim,"Gizmos is a quick engine-building games. During a player’s turn, he can either buy a card from the display, take a resource ball, put a card from the display in the archive, or buy a card from the archive. Most of the cards allow you to gain bonuses when you do one of these things--for example, you could get a random ball whenever you take a yellow ball, or you could get a victory point whenever you build a red card. Other cards increase your storage capacity or let you use certain balls as wilds. The key is that all of these bonuses can chain together, so performing one action can let you do a whole bunch of other stuff. Of course, this can snowball a little for a player who gets a nice engine quickly, but the game is short enough that this doesn’t matter too much. This is a great little filler.  (4 plays)"
246192,7.0,Pickletheonion,"Neat little game, although the simple rules were explained in an overly wordy and complicated way. There was considerable confusion over the difference between file and archive- which basically turned out to be the same thing. Now we know what we are doing we’ve played a few times and seem to be building up some strategy behind our play."
246192,7.2,pikaia,Best with lower player counts. Can suffer from runaway leader issues (as all engine builders can) but the short play time makes it fun for what it is.
246192,7.0,pinkamenapie,"I thought I would enjoy this even more than I do, it looked great, it's good. The engine building is fun, but since everything builds the engine, you can end up with turns that drag. ""Okay I did this, so now I get to do this, oh yeah and I gotta do this, did I do that? I was supposed to do that, okay I'll do that, which let's me do this"" etc."

Its true, but the effect of that is turns stay fast, and the game ends with you itching for more. Alternatively waiting for others long chains at the end of the game would leave you bored. Very strong game."
246192,7.5,pmduguay,Pretty fun and engaging engine building game with lots of combo available. Components seem unfinished and not up the standard of CMON or even what sugggests the beauty of the box itself.
246192,6.0,Poddster,"Quite a dry engine builder. The theme is so thin they might as well have made it an abstract game.  I like it for the engine-building, but it doesn't draw me back in. It's just so bare-bones and straight-forward. You need to play it at least once before you understand how important the ""combos"" are."
246192,8.0,porkchop_tw,"I've finally get to play this engine building game by Walker-Harding, who is one of the rising board game designer from Australia and I've enjoyed some of his designs all throughout the years. You need to balance your energy and cards that you play. The theme doesn't really matter in this game. The cards that you build into your engine helps you in different aspect of the game and I find that it is the most crucial to choose a level 3 design that fits your overall engine. Upgrade cards are must haves as well. It shares some similarities with engine games in this weight (Splendor and Century Spice) but it is unique to stand on its own."

246192,7.0,Qumpelblase,"Meine Meinung zu diesem Spiel ist ein großes Hin und Her. Engine Builder sind cool und auch hier kann man sich coole Strategien und Kombos zurechtlegen. Trotzdem ist die Entscheidungsfreiheit (vorallem im fortgeschrittenen Spiel) beschränkt und schon in der ersten Spielrunde einen Funken öde. Die Gizmos sind klasse designed, spielen aber keine Rolle und sind die meiste Zeit verdeckt. Und die Murmeln und der Murmelspender sind ein cooles Gimmick, das manchmal aber hängt. Alles in allem pendelt sich Gizmos auf einer starken 7 ein."
246192,7.4,R3g0_0,"Gizmos è un gioco divertente dove i giocatori, da 2 a 4 dai 14 anni in su, si trasformeranno in scienziati per 30-50 minuti. Non è particolarmente complicato e ciò lo rende adatto anche ai giocatori meno esperti. Il mix di meccaniche utilizzato è ben implementato, per cui le partite risultano piacevoli e scorrevoli nonostante ci sia pochissima interazione fra i giocatori. Se la fortuna è un fattore trascurabile, limitata quasi solo ai bonus di pesca alla cieca, la strategia di gioco non lo è affatto. Insomma un titolo colorato, divertente, semplice e strategico, consigliato un po' a tutti coloro che vogliono passare una bella oretta di divertimento con un gioco semplice ma per nulla banale.  https://www.justnerd.it/2018/12/12/gizmos-la-recensione/"
246192,6.0,RabbitFly,"The pure engine building game. I got this because I wanted a satisfying engine building game that really focused on this mechanic.   It does focus on it, but I have yet to find it really satisfying.   The game works well, plays at a decent enough time, and is quite easy to introduce to others. Engines can quickly become a bit complex for new players though, but it generally works out well enough.   I like that the game is built around how you can make engines that trigger of each other and make some complex combos. But the game is often over before any engine you imagine becomes a reality. As such I have been left feeling wanting.   The marbles don't add as much to the table presence as I hoped and the card quality could be better. I have not found another game that better fit the pure engine building criteria, so it is likely to stay. However I am eyeing Furnace and I do wonder how Gizmos will fare once that becomes available."

246192,7.0,Ragnarok1er,"[i][u]Disclaimer:[/u][/i] This is a [color=#000099][b]standalone game[/b][/color]. Its rating is based on [color=#000099][b]desire to play[/b][/color].  I found [b]Gizmos[/b] to a  remarkably similar to [i]Splendor[/i], probably too much for my taste. Judge by yourself as both games feature: - 3 rows of cards that you can buy from, with the low-cost cards from the first row helping you buy the more expensive ones at the top ; - a mechanism where you can reserve a card for later, gaining a resource by doing so ; - a limit to the resources you can hold (10 gems / 6 marbles) - a very math-y design where the theme feels pasted on and never adds anything (despite some cool illustrations, I never felt like an inventor in [b]Gizmos[/b]) - a final score quick enough to reach that the game is closer to a sprint than a marathon ; - and even some fun material to play with (the poker chips for [i]Splendor[/i], the marble dispenser for [b]Gizmos[/b]).  Now, of course, [b]Gizmos[/b] is an engine-building game while [i]Splendor[/i] is more about set collection (there is no equivalent to the Noble tiles in [b]Gizmos[/b]). Luckily for me, my knowledge of [i]Splendor[/i] allowed me to be immediately decent at [b]Gizmos[/b]. In particular, I quickly identified that building your engine for too long is a bad thing and that you should pivot to victory points after a few turns. For more on pivot points in engine building games, read these great articles by Morten Petersen : https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/77539/pivot-points-vp-clogging-and-catchup-mechanisms & https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/85492/voluntary-and-forced-pivot-points ). That's one thing I would change about the game, by the way: getting to run your engine in full steam for a few more turns (say, end the game at 20 gizmos instead of 16) would be very satisfying and maybe even allow for some late-game strategies (like boosting your marble or research capacities) to become viable.  The one thing that sets [b]Gizmos[/b] apart is the Age III deck, which contains several cards that function very differently from the rest and allow for some different strategies like accumulating marbles. It's also the one thematic thing they have going on: the game is the mad scientist trope, yet the rest of it is very formulaic in its approach: pick a yellow resource, get a free blue one, trade it for a wild one, yawn, yawn, end my turn. By allowing the player to think outside the box a little, these cards are the best part of [b]Gizmos[/b].  Unfortunately, they are both insufficient in numbers and way too varied in power levels. The gizmos giving you 8 points for 4 marbles (all the other ones have a 1:1 ratio) are way too strong. They're supposed to have a drawback as they forbid you from using the Research action, but you can play around that very easily. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the cards giving you 1 point for 3 VP tokens are unbelievably weak.  One last gripe I have with the game: the first few turns feel very luck-based. Some age I cards feel much stronger than others, and you can get a definite advantage by getting the color you want from the top of the dispenser (where you pick a marble blindly). This lead isn't unsurmontable, but I truly felt bad for my friend when I got the right color 3 times in a row and he didn't, as if the boardgaming gods didn't want us to have a fair fight based on intellect and decision-making.  In the end, I would never turn down a game of [b]Gizmos[/b]. This may not be obvious from this review, so let me give it some love. It's fun to build your little engine and even if you're losing, the game is quick enough that it stays fun until the end. The theme is neat, the graphic design is well done, the rules unambiguous and the Age III cards offer some interesting gameplay alternatives.  I think [b]Gizmos[/b] could benefit greatly from an expansion that would add other Age III cards to make each game feel truly different, maybe even fix some of the balance and luck-based issues I have with the game. Until then, I think there are better designs out there: [i]Splendor[/i] for the tense race where no move can be wasted, and [i]Terraforming Mars[/i] or [i]Wingspan[/i] for the more thematic and satisfying engine building aspect."
246192,8.5,rainbowoatmeal,"This is a fun, fast engine builder. The marble dispenser reminds me of Potion Explosion, but there’s more engine building here. The one downside is that the game is a bit fiddly, especially in the latter portions of the game. Tons of cards may be activated, and it will be difficult to keep track which one has been triggered and which one has not. The game does give a great feeling of accomplishment at the end. It plays in 20-30 minutes and can be a fantastic gateway game."
246192,7.0,rainyl,成也combo，败也combo。 游戏核心是引擎构筑，构筑起来后确实非常爽，但问题也不少。一是爆珠的引擎构筑太依赖于combo，对于纯新人来说还是有门槛的。二是游戏流程比较短，构筑好引擎后爽两回合游戏就结束了。三是领先玩家很容易形成对其他玩家的压制，一路领先直到获胜。 可以用来推新，但比较挑人，普适性不太好。

What has been triggered may be hard to track at times, and hard to understand for people new to boardgaming. -Has some strategy and different paths to victory. -Very multiplayer solitaire-y. -Cool marble dispenser. -Game sometimes feels like it's over too soon. -Good light engine builder overall. -Player boards are player aids."

I thought Splendor was too dry but Gizmos with the marbles is what keeps it lighthearted and fun.  The original dispenser is a pain but at least with the second edition, you don't need to construct the cardboard set up. However, it did lose some of its charm and color.  I made a storage container for it that I'm quite proud of! It was a gizmo for my Gizmos. haha"

I had passed it by a few times because the theme didn't snag me, and theme is very important to me in games. But it's an engine builder, which I love, and a very satisfying one at that. This game is quick and easy to set up, and fairly each to teach. Yet in spite of that, I think it has a lot of depth and variability; strategy is going to vary widely based on what Gizmos come out in a given game.

You can make plays and try different things. I wish the iconography were a bit better. The issue is mostly that a lot of the icons are a bit too similar.  And I wish there were a bit more variance and excitement in the level 3 cards, but I can see how that might be hard to balance.  But its definitely a good ""popcorn"" game.

246192,8.58,rmiczek,An interesting engine building game.  There are multiple strategies to maximize points.  Feels a little like Century Road as you are trying to manipulate your tableau to get the most out of your turn.  It also has a little Splendor in it too as you can buy gizmos from the community pool but you can archive them to save them for yourself.   It has a little defense aspect but isn't too but overall is not too confrontational.  Really a fun interesting game with good production with the energy tower (although it was a pain to punch and get together).

My dispenser came broken, a marble was missing, and the company sent a new cardboard dispenser but not the plastic one. For that I'd have to buy a new copy of the game The replacement is also a little messed up but not as bad as the original and like most parts of the game it's kind of unnecessary so that's fine."
246192,8.5,rodenbeckb,A pure engine builder. It is very satisfying to create your engine and see it run. The stand and marbles are a great component for this game. It adds to the experience when collecting your resources.  
246192,6.0,Rodge,"This is quite an enjoyable game, with lovely art and really solid game mechanics! Gameplay is fun and games have a nice engine builder feel, but plays in a really good time. Game design is really good!  However, it is REALLY let down by the component quality.   First, the marble dispenser is pretty awful. It, constantly, has marbles escape. If you want to properly randomise things, you need to put your hand in and move the marbles around - which will always result in some escaping onto the table. When they come out onto the selectable area, they'll often roll off to the side, leading to loads of marbles following. In short, the dispenser is quite poor - and I believe the 2nd edition plastic version is little better.  The quality of the cards wasn't great either, with many having marks on the back. Luckily, it's not so serious a game that people might try to memorise the backs - or sleeving would be required.  Lastly, the game comes with two rule books - the core rules, and a reference book. The reference book was in the wrong language (at least the core book was the correct one).   CMON have the worst customer support in the entire boardgaming world. Their (non-) advice, for each issue, was to be more careful with the dispenser, sleeve the cards and to just print out the reference sheet, which is provided on their website. I'm really glad that I received Gizmos as a present, and didn't pay any of my own money for it, or I'd have given it a MUCH harsher score..."

246192,7.0,Scottyglc,"I am typically skeptical of super hyped games with a new gimmick, but Gizmos is the real deal.  The marble dispenser is a cool effect and allows you to pick or go fishing for energy you need to build new gizmos.  The meat of the game is in adding new gizmos that start to play off of each other, allowing for turns where a chain reaction can activate multiple gizmos.  This game is fairly simple to learn and plays quickly once you know it.  There isn't a ton you can do to mitigate your opponents other than trying to get gizmos they may want, so it's a race to 16 gizmos.  After not playing it for awhile, I decided to let this one go.

246192,6.0,shmonkey,"Straight engine builder. Pretty simple. Not super engaging, but gameplay can be tight. I enjoyed this more than arcane academy, which i played around the same time and largely covers the same ground. I even gave the same rating but this supersedes AA. "

246192,6.0,soccastar001,"This is a dilution of an engine building game down to just the engine building piece with a Potion Explosion-style toy gimmick tacked on.  In this game you collect colored balls and use those colored balls to buy different machine parts that let you pick more colored balls, store more colored balls, turn some balls into balls of other colors.  You can create really long chain reactions later in the game and if you like that style of domino engine building you might really enjoy it.  I think I would rather play games with more mechanics and I am simply not for this ball chute toy gimmick.  It can't create a very random distribution like something like a deck of cards can and it is really there just as an additional gimmick and that annoys me."
246192,9.0,SocksRule,"Great gateway plus engine builder game. You use energy (the marbles) to buy cards, which can trigger other actions on your tableau. Winner is first to 16 (?) cards or 4 (?) level III cards. I find this to be a more interesting version of Splendor. The only problem with this game is I'm not sure when I would play it. It's a bit too heavy for those who don't want anything behind gateway level and it's too light for my typical game nights, but it is a great game so I'm conflicted there."

246192,9.0,Southern Fried GN,"This is a wonderful engine building game from CMON, I like Wingspan better and I wouldn't compare the two but people do. It is a game where you are pulling plastic marbles out of a machine which could trigger other abilities. You use the marbles to build gizmos which add to you abilities, so the more gizmos you make the more abilities you have and the more resources you get to build more gizmos. Awesome game a great card play with the abilities. Simple and a great pace. 9/10."
246192,7.0,SpaceAlien,"Sold. Decent game, enjoyed it but my solo experience was feeling repetitive. Sometimes I’m cool with that but I feel this is more enjoyable multi-player.   I think my groups would play it but I didn’t like taking it around to other places because the marbles roll off and it doesn’t seem sturdy. "
246192,9.0,Spazzfist,"Disclaimer - this comment is based on my first play  I really enjoyed this game. One thing which I appreciated about it is that it is the ""next step"" for people who like or are at least familiar with, Splendor.

246192,7.0,Spootilious,Gizmos is a great chain based game. In order to have the most fun with it however you need the right players. It is not a game for everyone but I enjoyed its uniqueness and gimmick.
246192,7.0,Sprayoncrayon,"My wife and son like this game.   Imagine Splendor and Potion Explosion had a child. That's Gizmos, an engine building game where you're drawing marbles from a dispenser to trigger multiple effects in an attempt to earn the most valuable cards for your engine."
246192,8.0,Sprout,"Great fun, it is comborific! And super quick!"
246192,7.0,Spyzou,"True to form, Walker-Harding has taken a proven concept and significantly improved it while keep the same feeling. The engine builder you wished Splendor was. Themeless but mechanically more interesting and involve. Really feels like your building something. But just like Splendor, it won't stand out to repeated play."
246192,5.0,srand,"Clever, overproduced combo-engine-builder that feels like another iteration on Splendor++ -- about the same weight as Century: Spice Road.  This time, the cards players purchase provide bonuses when one of the main actions is taken again; bonus actions can themselves chain to other bonuses or improve other capabilities. The result is a mono-focus on combo-building. There's enough variance in the gizmos to provide some superficial variability, but that variance combined with random draws and random availability of marbles make it feel much more random than its close competitors. The research action (draw X cards from a gizmo deck and build/stash one) changes that calculus, but also reduces the competition and interactivity that arise from the market constraints in Splendor and Century.  Overall, I think good but not great. The insane marble dispenser does add to the experience but the solitary combo-building and luck of the draw are likely to be more important than the other players."

246192,7.0,StalkingButler,"Decent engine builder, very comparable to Splendor.  It's certainly sexier than Splendor, with it's chaining abilities and silly marble tower.  Your turns are more interesting, but other people's turns can be obnoxious as you watch them slowly move through all the chaining reactions of their engine.  In other words, I'd probably rather play it than Splendor, but I'm not sure it's actually a better game.  I prefer the difficult decisions and combos of Century: Spice Road to either game."
246192,8.0,StandSure,Cute and fun engine-builder.  Similar play to Splendor but I think it is more fun.  A little more luck involved with the marble drawing.
246192,8.0,StarletPhoenix,started slow in the beginning but oh so fun when the engine got going!  it was great setting up my gizmos to play off each other for a highly beneficial turn.  I also liked how sometimes a strategy needed to change based on which color marbles were currently coming down the shoot.  It encourages you to actively think on how best to turn it to your advantage.
246192,5.0,starspangledgirl,It's OK. Reminds me of Splendor but just not that interesting.

246192,7.2,Surya,"tl;dr: family friendly engine builder  This game is a bit like other engine builder games like Race for the Galaxy and what not, but a lot more family friendly. During the game you acquire cards that improve the power of the standard actions, trigger combos (hopefully) and give you points. As the game goes on, every action you perform will become more and more powerful. If you make the best engine you will have a chance at victory. It is quick and good fun and holds enough depth to interest gamers but it is simple enough (with very short rules) to appeal to families as well. You know, that sweet spot that can lead to huge sales as you appeal to a very wide audience. Pretty good stuff to start or end the night, but for me not the main dish.

246192,9.0,Tall_Walt,"Fun, light engine-builder with marbles. Nice marbles, but the dispenser is maybe too cute for cardboard: a bag and a tray for just the six available marbles might have been a better choice.  Though in a way much like Splendor or Century: Spice Road, I find the engine-building much more satisfying in Gizmos.  The 2nd edition dispenser bottom still jams and reveals the 7th marble to players looking at it at a low angle in good light. I think marbles dropped in the back corners of the dispenser will not return to play quickly. I am using a bag instead. Table presence is nice, but so is a functional game."

246192,7.0,theaaron,"For some reason this game didn't grab me as much as I expected.  I consider Century to be one of the best games of the last few years, and Gizmos has a similar feel. Gizmos has you collecting different colors, converting to other colors, and using them to buy cards. Unlike Century, though, Gizmos has you building up a combo engine where you get bonuses each time you do an action.  It's a fine game, but nothing especially noteworthy."

246192,8.0,theSlex,"Gizmos was a surprise hit of Gen Con 2018. Potion Explosion is fine. I don't care for Splendor. This seems to draw heavily from both but manages to create a much more engaging game in the process.  The marble hopper is a fun component, the iconography and player aids are top notch, and the engine building is quick and fulfilling. I love being able to grab items for future use at the cost of an action.  I look forward to future plays!"
246192,8.0,thestoryguy,"This one is a brain burner, and I love it! The unique cards with the weird Gizmos are great. There is a lot to keep track of though. Maybe a system to track which cards you've used on your turn would be beneficial."
246192,8.0,TheThreeOfUs,This is our families favorite pure engine builder. The marble dispenser is awesome and totally helps make the game more fun.

246192,7.5,throatwarbler,"Gizmos has just taken out Splendor in every possible way.  The engine building mechanic is more interesting than simple resource production, the game lasts long enough for a clever engine designer to marvel over the production of his or her creation, the components are top notch and the overall fun factor is fantastic.    Well done, CMON.  Let's have an expansion that adds a plastic marble dispenser as this game should see a LOT of table time."
246192,6.0,Thrylos,Nice but nothing too much exciting and it takes a lot of space.
246192,7.0,Thunkd,"'d never heard of this game, which looked rather like a gimmicky kid's game.  In the game you're trying to build machines (cards) which give you abilities and are worth points. The game ends when someone builds 16 machines (or some number close to that).  You build cards with marbles. The game comes with a contraption that holds marbles and feeds six or seven of them into a trough that are available to use. When one is removed, the next one slides down.  You have a couple of basic abilities at the start of the game. You can pick a marble from the trough. You can reserve a card from the central display (which lets you take a random marble from the marble contraption's hopper). You can build a card either from the central display or from your reserve. And you can look through a few cards from the deck of machines to try and find something you like (and either reserve or build it).  One neat thing about this game is that it's an engine builder. So you might add something that says when you build a machine you get to do a pick action. Or that when you pick a yellow marble you get to get a random marble as well. Or that when you build a black building you gain a point. If you can string a couple of those together you can end up with mega-turns where your initial action triggers four or five sub-actions. Late in the game you can have some powerful engines running.  The game was a lot of fun. And it feels like every game will spiral out a different way depending on what you're able to cobble together for your engine."

The ideia is to get cards in order to make a well-oiled machine, as to get resources, points, space for marbles and cards, etc. The final round is triggered when someone has 16 inventions built or four level III. The person with the most points will be the winner!  [thing=246192][/thing] seemed to me as a better Splendor. It has a good pace, being also easy to teach and play. The sinergies between the cards are nice to trigger and give more for the players to ponder about. Interaction is still very low, being basically in a light blocking of cards. Luck has a strong part, as many powers allow to randomly draw extra marbles, and some colors of these will fit way better with what you are doing then others.  Replay value seems high at first, with the big decks of inventions, specially in the level III, that players barely dent in a game (while the level I are nearly all used), but the types of abilities of the inventions tend to be quite similar, which lead to same paths of strategies.  Overall, [thing=246192][/thing] was fine, but the low interaction and sameness of game takes a big toll. It isn't long enough to became boring, but does lack in the fun department after a while.

246192,6.0,TyDeL,"Think I can officially pass on Splendor. I haven't wanted to get rid of it because, while I'm burned out on it, it does have mass appeal for simple rules and play. Gizmos has just a little bit more rules overhead, but much more avenues of strategy to play with, and personal satisfaction of an engine you built.  Had someone win a game of Gizmos by creating an engine that was purely designed to benefit from banking cards, and then building those cards, and getting benefits in both ways. Someone else might have an engine that's built off of searching the deck for cards to build. Or just creating a cascading waterfall of resources that rain down on you teach time you build something.  It's satisfying and pretty fun while being surprisingly quick to play. All that praise said, head-down engine-building games are really not my thing. I think they're a fun little puzzle, but they're not the kind of experience that draws me to board games. There's no interaction with other players.  I'll happily play Gizmos any time someone wants to, it's a good time killer, but it's not something that excites me to play."
246192,7.2,tyroll,"Un juego sencillo y muy estratégico, donde los combos se forman uno detrás de otros.  El detalle, es que uno debe recordar muy bien la simbología, pero ya en la tercera partida, todos los aprenden muy bien."
246192,2.0,ubRtstcl,"Very uninspired and generic vanilla boringness. Resources are all the same. Colours of gizmos are all the same. Plastic Dispenser doesn't work properly. Each Category of trigger has 1 or 2 outcomes at most across all gizmos. Also why use marbles if they just act as a resource, try using them to roll or something. Completely soulless game."
246192,1.0,ultimoratio,"There's no trade off between taking a level 3 card or a level 1 card. Highly tactical game.  --------------------  Really enjoy the chain reaction of things you can do with your gizmos as the effects cascades. However, it is still very solitaire, and the marble dispenser can be very predictable if people don't shuffle the marbles in the container properly.  But the game is snappy and the cascading effect is very appeasing."
246192,8.0,usualfool,"This is a whimsically pure engine builder, and a lot of fun.  I wish there was a bit more theme, but that's a small complaint."

246192,7.0,vanbear,I bought this game mainly because of the presentation. The ball dispenser is very cool to play with and the chain reactions are satisfying. I like to return to this game once in a while even though there are almost none player interactions.
246192,7.5,VaultBoy,Fun engine builder that doesn't overstay its welcome. I enjoy the way things can chain together for big turns.
246192,5.0,veemonroe,A great little engine builder that just happens to be worse at being Splendor than Splendor.  I spent the entire game wishing I was playing... Splendor.  The iconography is also mega-confusing.
246192,7.5,VeganDodo0,"I enjoyed my plays of this engine builder. One of the folks in my game group detests this game, so I rarely play it."
246192,8.0,velochy,"Basically Splendor 2.0 - shares many similar mechanics, but the engine you build is far more explosive."
246192,8.0,Vera42,"It's an engine building with some really fun and unique elements. The rules might sound kind of complex at first but it's pretty easy once you get used to the mechanics and understand what each item in the dashboard does. The components are nice and well made, especially the marble dispenser. The objective is clear and you can make some really good combos with the cards you buy."

246192,8.5,VileRocK,Accessible engine building. Very good components and table presence when setup.   Base game may require some balancing tweaks as patterns emerge after extended replays - the designer has added an alternate scoring mechanism in one of the extra card sets that can be applied to the base game as it is. (to value players spreading wide over all actions instead of superstacking 1-2 of them) 
246192,9.0,VintageBullet,Such a fun engine building game and it's so easy to teach and play !  Must own for me and I don't see it leaving my collection.
246192,10.0,vionemc,It keeps hitting the table. Everyone doesn't stand losing and the winner still enjoys the engine building.

246192,7.8,wakakafat,"(Recent update): surface less on our table due to flooding games available, but we still keep this and glad to play occasionally. A solid keeper to us.   (After 20 plays) Rating stabilize to 7.5 and closer to 8. This is still subject quite a lot for the card being launched and the marble you could get, but the bottom line is this is a FUN game and this is the easy selection as a after dinner / quick session between some heavier games.  (After 10 plays) Rating increases to 7.5 since it hits my family night time table almost every day and my wife loves it. It seems to me that racing to be the fastest builder is still the major path to victory, and the cost for blocking others may not worth every time. Still have a doubt for its long term replay-ability but will glad to play again in this while.   (Initial rating after 1 play). Better than expected since I have an initial impression / bias that this is the inferior version of Splendor in terms of its  neatness and aesthetic point of view. But the powerful combo is very satisfying and this is not Splendor can offer. You will always want to try out how to compound the best combo but I will give it a few more sessions to confirm its long term replayability."

246192,8.0,Wanderer999,This is very likely a Potion Explosion cum Splendor killer!!
246192,7.0,warlock000,"Fun, pure engine builder. A step-up in complexity from games like Splendor. It has enough interesting decisions to keep the advanced players involved while still being accessible for beginners. Just remember to keep the player count low, more people just introduce downtime (the pacing is still good, but I feel that the fourth player adds nothing to the game). Also, it's a bit heavy on iconography and it will take you a couple of moves to fully understand all the abilities (the icons add to the weight of the game). Still, it's a really solid product and a good pick for more casual gaming sessions."

246192,7.75,wedgeex,Checking at GenCon 2018 for this!
246192,8.0,Wendigoat,"[b]A quick engine builder that's simple and satisfying[/b] - - - - - - - - - - I'm sure I gave this game at least half a point because of the satisfaction of the marbles. But the game here is super solid too. In this game you have a number of actions you can do on your turn, involving ways to take marbles (the resources of the game) and building ""gizmos"". Throughout the game you will be essentially upgrading these different actions to accelerate your marble-getting process or sneak in some extra points. I love that you can build your awesome engine to completion in about 30-40 minutes. While I don't think this game does anything entirely ""new"" (besides that marble contraption perhaps), what it does it does well. You start with very little but quickly build up your gizmos and right at the perfect time the game ends. While I do like the simplicity of the game, I do hope one day they bring out an expansion that adds some more variety and freshness to the game. Overall though, this is a great little engine building game you can play with pretty much anyone in about 30 minutes."
246192,7.0,Wendyjo73,"Played once at game night. As everyone says, Splendor-like but with an added layer of depth. Really enjoyed and will probably purchase."

246192,8.0,Wiegrief,Ken
246192,7.0,Wigdogger,"A light-ish engine builder that leads towards some fun combinations and chains in the late game. The iconography is mostly straightforward, and you have to plan a couple of steps ahead to work out what others are doing and where you need to go. It's Splendor with slightly different theming and mechanisms, but the engine-building and combo-chaining feels fresher here.  It's not one I'd play all the time, but I do like that it plays quickly and smoothly."
246192,9.0,william kohler,"A sort of splendor, where you build more and more your combo engine to gain marbles !!  Highest score : William = 44/31/25/24 Tasya = 38 Hans= 45"
246192,4.0,wilsonza,"A reasonably fun, light engine builder. However, it didn't really replace anything for me and I have a series of other go-to family weight games that my kids enjoy. I wouldn't turn it down if others wanted to play it, but can't see myself picking this up."

246192,9.0,Withjrock,"My recent favorite market analysis game.  Lots of people love Splendor... which is fun, but never makes the table anymore, because this game is just... better.  Quick to teach, good iconography, fun art, good game time, enough balance/variety, quality components...  I have nothing bad to say about it.  Personally, I think it's underrated on BGG."
246192,9.0,wiz8mom,"Our favorite engine builder for now. Icon heavy but super easy to get the hang of. Simpler than Wingspan and Everdell, but with more triggering reactions."
246192,7.7,wizpop,"I decent engine builder but feels like it would get rather samey over time, possible due mostly to the abstract nature. Still fun and would play again. I really like Roll for the Galaxy and would easily play that (a sort of similar game I feel) over this."
246192,5.0,wkover,"How stupid am I that I prefer this to Splendor because it has marbles? Inexplicably stupid.  Though Gizmos also has triggered activity, which makes it more fun. Build, then pick, then blind grab again, etc.  Though I can't help but think that winning engine games come down to whoever purchases the undercosted and/or perfect component at just the right time.  Bordering on a 6. Was fun once, and worth playing 1-2 more times."
246192,6.0,Wolkster,"Lots of fun.  My group immediately wanted to play it again.  Needs an expansion like Splendor to take it to another level, like Splendor’s expansion."

246192,8.0,WoogBlaine,This game is always fun and it's a neat little engine builder. Great game to teach and the marble dispenser is a gimmick that just works!
246192,8.5,Wrightboy,"As of 2019 this is the best intro engine builder I've played yet. Fun marble gimmick, quick turns, and you always feel like you get to run your engine for a nice long while before the game ends. "
246192,9.0,Wydolphins43,"Great game, really fun mechanics. A bit tough to teach to new people, but after just 1 play through you have a good idea on how to play."
246192,5.0,XanderF,"Very interesting game, but...sort of maybe too much 'multiplayer solitaire', as there is no player interaction *at all*? Best you can manage is trying to identify some card or marble another player wants before they can pull it, but with the number of conversion actions available, and preciousness of actions GENERALLY, trying to disrupt another player's options in any way feels like a choice that is ruinous to yourself by at LEAST one order of magnitude, as you'll almost always benefit far more from actions directly benefitting yourslef.  Soooo much to *like* about it, but the lack of ability to react in any way to what someone else is doing feels...too great?"

246192,7.0,Xonim,"You start with just a single combo ability, but by the end of the game you might combo 6-8 (or more!) abilities together on a single action. It gets pretty crazy. Easy to teach but there's more depth and decision-making here than it may seem. I really like that they build the insert in a way that fits the marble tower without having to take it apart after each game."
246192,6.0,Xruptor,Great game but the design of the dispenser is terrible.  The marbles keep constantly getting stuck in it.  I have the plastic dispenser and it's awful.  We have to constantly shake it or put our hand in it to get the marbles to dispense.
246192,9.0,xxIronGolemxx,A neat little engine building game with cool components.  The artwork on the cards is interesting and varied over the cards.
246192,7.0,xyoxyo,Pretty fast and fun combo card game. I quite like this game more than Splendor even it shares some mechanism.  A little surprise for me to see that someone play this game in 75 minutes because my group finished this game in 15 minutes each time.
246192,7.0,Ybrichev,"This is a nice looking game that uses marbles in place of cubes or cards as used in other types of builder games.  It starts slow and as you build cards by using ""energy"" aka marbles, it escalates.  The game is quick enough to not outstay its welcome."

The combos that started cropping up in the late game were a bit much for me to follow in my first game that makes me wonder if this would be a good family type game... but its certainly something I wouldn't say no to as a ""heavy filler"" at game night."
246192,8.0,Zacrulo,Engine Building - Medium - 2-4
246192,6.0,Zalasta,"The marble dispenser is eye catching but seemed to malfunction occasionally, where someone will inadvertently push too many through the hole, thereby messing up the display.  The actual engine building is decent, but could be slow going if you don't have enough converters to change the colors of your energy, because you definitely will not get what you want.  Research then archive seemed like to be a lot more efficient than taking directly from the card display.  It's a decent introductory engine builder, and the components are nice, but for me it's not very exciting to play, so it definitely goes to the growing pile of ""once is enough"" games."

246192,8.0,zb1035,"Probably one of the best family games of 2018. A very light rules set makes this good for families if they can keep track of everything. The marbles are a cute gimmick. The key is to remember you’re trying to win, not just build cards. You can really play differently every time. A very solid game. "
246192,7.0,zedeemia,Super clean engine-builder with a toy factor that's a bit of a gimmick but fun to play with.
246192,9.0,Zedsdead,"Hm, I liked this better than I expected. The intuitive stacking system deftly mitigates the multi-trigger-tracking headaches common to engine building games.  And the fact that the marble dispenser tends to jam up is handled by the frequency of players pulling marbles from the hopper, which unjams it.  And you get a full game experience in 40min.  My early impression: 9 stars. We'll see how it shakes out after a few more plays."

Aunque siento que hay demasiados efectos en las cartas y si no estás atento 100% puedes olvidar algunos efectos que te podrían costar la partida.
